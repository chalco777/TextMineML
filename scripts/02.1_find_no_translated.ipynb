            "   resumen      : Peru celebrates 200 years of independence in 2021. Over this period of independent life, and despite the turbulent socio-political scenarios, from internal armed conflict to economic crisis to political instability over the last 40 years, Peru has experienced major changes on its epidemiological and population health profile. Major advancements in maternal and child health as well as in communicable diseases have been achieved in recent decades, and today Peru faces an increasing burden of non-communicable diseases including mental health conditions. In terms of the configuration of the public health system, Peru has also strived to secure country-wide optimal health care, struggling in particular to improve primary health care and intercultural services. The science and technology infrastructure has also evolved, although the need for substantial investments remains if advancing science is to be a national priority. Climate change will also bring significant challenges to population health given Peru's geographical and microclimates diversity. Looking back over the 200-years of independence, we present a summary of key advances in selected health-related fields, thus serving as the basis for reflections on pending agendas and future challenges, in order to look forward to ensuring the future health and wellbeing of the Peruvian population. Resumen (translated abstract): El Perú cumple 200 años de independencia en 2021. Durante estos dos siglos de vida independiente, junto con periodos sociales y políticos turbulentos, incluyendo un conflicto armado interno, hiperinflación y la inestabilidad política de los últimos 40 años, el Perú ha experimentado importantes cambios en su perfil epidemiológico con repercusiones directas en la salud de la población. En las últimas décadas, los indicadores de salud materno-infantil y de las enfermedades transmisibles muestran mejoría importante, pero el país se enfrenta de manera simultánea a una carga cada vez mayor de enfermedades no transmisibles y de salud mental. En cuanto a los sistemas de salud pública, se han realizado esfuerzos por aumentar la cobertura y calidad de la atención de salud en todo el país, apostándose en particular por mejorar la atención primaria. La ciencia y tecnología relacionadas con la salud también han mejorado, aunque si se quiere que la ciencia sea una prioridad nacional, son necesarias inversiones sustanciales. El cambio climático traerá importantes desafíos para la salud de la población, dada la diversidad geográfica y de microclimas del país. Para conmemorar los 200 años de vida independiente del Perú, presentamos un resumen de avances clave en diversas áreas y temas relacionados con la salud. Este repaso sirve como base para reflexionar sobre agendas y desafíos pendientes y futuros, con el fin de asegurar la salud y el bienestar de la población peruana en las próximas décadas.\n",

Obwohl sich ein solches Konzept in einkommensstarken Gebieten oder in Ländern mit einheitlichen Gesundheitssystemen problemlos einführen ließe, wird der Umsetzung von PCC in Ländern wie Peru, in denen der allgemeine Zugang zur Gesundheitsversorgung sowie andere strukturelle Probleme nach wie vor eine Herausforderung darstellen, keine Priorität eingeräumt. In Peru wird seit beinahe zwei Jahrzehnten zu PCC geforscht, doch hat dies in der akademischen Welt sowie bei Entscheidungsträgern, Gesundheitsfachkräften oder Patienten bislang keinen Entwicklungsbedarf hervorgerufen. In diesem Beitrag geben wir einen Überblick über die bisherige Forschung zu PCC in Peru und skizzieren die Herausforderungen, die bei der Umsetzung von PCC in die klinische Praxis zu meistern sein werden.\n",

            "Abstract: Syphilis is a sexually and vertically transmitted bacterial infection caused by the bacterium Treponema pallidum. Its prevalence is high in low-income and middle-income countries, and its incidence has increased in high-income countries in the last few decades among men who have sex with men. Syphilis is a major cause of adverse pregnancy outcomes in low-income and middle-income countries. Clinical features include a primary chancre at the point of inoculation, followed weeks later by the rash of secondary syphilis, a latent period, and in some cases, involvement of the eyes, CNS, and cardiovascular systems. It is diagnosed serologically. A single intramuscular dose of long-acting benzathine penicillin is recommended for people who have had syphilis for less than 1 year and longer courses for people with late latent syphilis. Control strategies include screening and treatment of all pregnant women, and targeted interventions for groups at high risk. Vaccine development, research on antibiotic prophylaxis, and digital messaging as prevention strategies are ongoing.\n",

            "Abstract: Multimorbidity (two or more coexisting conditions in an individual) is a growing global challenge with substantial effects on individuals, carers and society. Multimorbidity occurs a decade earlier in socioeconomically deprived communities and is associated with premature death, poorer function and quality of life and increased health-care utilization. Mechanisms underlying the development of multimorbidity are complex, interrelated and multilevel, but are related to ageing and underlying biological mechanisms and broader determinants of health such as socioeconomic deprivation. Little is known about prevention of multimorbidity, but focusing on psychosocial and behavioural factors, particularly population level interventions and structural changes, is likely to be beneficial. Most clinical practice guidelines and health-care training and delivery focus on single diseases, leading to care that is sometimes inadequate and potentially harmful. Multimorbidity requires person-centred care, prioritizing what matters most to the individual and the individual’s carers, ensuring care that is effectively coordinated and minimally disruptive, and aligns with the patient’s values. Interventions are likely to be complex and multifaceted. Although an increasing number of studies have examined multimorbidity interventions, there is still limited evidence to support any approach. Greater investment in multimorbidity research and training along with reconfiguration of health care supporting the management of multimorbidity is urgently needed.\n",

He sustained minor trauma from a wood splinter in his left thumb a month before presentation. Later, the wound ulcerated and started to drain serous fluid, with the subsequent appearance of multiple small, erythematous, and painless nodules in his left forearm. Some had undergone spontaneous suppuration with ensuing crusting. Culture of the aspirate from the nodular lesions was positive for Sporothrix schenckii by demonstrating dimorphism on enriched media. The colonies showed the characteristic bouquet-like microconidia in microscopy. The patient was started on itraconazole 200 mg daily for 3 months...\n",

Hypoxia in the placenta is associated with vascular remodeling, hypertension, metabolic changes, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and endoplasmic reticular stress. Hypoxia induces similar outcomes in other organs such as the lungs, kidney, and gut. Comparing and contrasting the effects of hypoxia on placental functions and functions of lung, kidney, and gut can lead to novel hypotheses and investigations, furthering our understanding of the impact of hypoxia on these diverse yet similar organs. In this review, we compare and contrast hypoxic placental responses to those in the other organ and cell systems.\n",

This article provides an overview of superficial, cutaneous, and subcutaneous mycoses that are more prevalent and/or geographically restricted to the tropics and briefly discusses fungal infections in returning travelers. Systematic data on such infections as travel-associated diseases are currently lacking, and enhanced surveillance for fungal infections may lead to early diagnosis and an understanding of the epidemiology of the fungal infections among travelers.\n",

            "Abstract: Leptospirosis, caused by pathogenic spirochetes belonging to the genus Leptospira, is a zoonosis with important impacts on human and animal health worldwide. Research on the mechanisms of Leptospira pathogenesis has been hindered due to slow growth of infectious strains, poor transformability, and a paucity of genetic tools. As a Results: of second generation sequencing technologies, there has been an acceleration of leptospiral genome sequencing efforts in the past decade, which has enabled a concomitant increase in functional genomics analyses of Leptospira pathogenesis. A pathogenomics approach, by coupling of pan-genomic analysis of multiple isolates with sequencing of experimentally attenuated highly pathogenic Leptospira, has resulted in the functional inference of virulence factors. The global Leptospira Genome Project supported by the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases to which key scientific contributions have been made from the international leptospirosis research community has provided a new roadmap for comprehensive studies of Leptospira and leptospirosis well into the future. This review describes functional genomics approaches to apply the data generated by the Leptospira Genome Project towards deepening our knowledge of virulence factors of Leptospira using the emerging discipline of pathogenomics.

            "Abstract: Sporotrichosis is a subacute or chronic mycosis predominant in tropical and subtropical regions. It is an infection of subcutaneous tissue caused by Sporothrix fungus species, but occasionally resulting in an extracutaneous condition, including osteoarticular, pulmonary, nervous central system, and ocular disease. Cases of ocular sporotrichosis are rare, but reports have been increasing in recent decades. Ocular infections usually occur in hyperendemic areas of sporotrichosis. For its classification, anatomic criteria are used. The clinical presentation is the infection in the ocular adnexal and intraocular infection. Ocular adnexa infections include palpebral, conjunctivitis, and infections of the lacrimal sac. Intraocular infection includes exogenous or endogenous endophthalmitis. Most infections in the ocular adnexal have been reported in Brazil, China and Peru, and intraocular infections are limited to the USA and Brazil. Diagnosis is performed from Sporothrix isolation in the mycological examination from ocular or skin samples. Both sporotrichosis in the ocular adnexa and intraocular infection can mimic several infectious and non-infectious medical conditions. Ocular adnexa infections are treated with potassium iodide and itraconazole. The intraocular infection is treated with amphotericin B.

            "Abstract: Humans encounter mycobacterial species due to their ubiquity in different environmental niches. In many individuals, pathogenic mycobacterial species may breach our first-line barrier defenses of the innate immune system and modulate the activation of phagocytes to cause disease of the respiratory tract or the skin and soft tissues, sometimes resulting in disseminated infection. Cutaneous mycobacterial infections may cause a wide range of clinical manifestations, which are divided into four main disease categories: (i) cutaneous manifestations of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, (ii) Buruli ulcer caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans and other related slowly growing mycobacteria, (iii) leprosy caused by Mycobacterium leprae and Mycobacterium lepromatosis, and (iv) cutaneous infections caused by rapidly growing mycobacteria. Clinically, cutaneous mycobacterial infections present with widely different clinical presentations, including cellulitis, nonhealing ulcers, subacute or chronic nodular lesions, abscesses, superficial lymphadenitis, verrucous lesions, and other types of findings. Mycobacterial infections of the skin and subcutaneous tissue are associated with important stigma, deformity, and disability. Geography-based environmental exposures influence the epidemiology of cutaneous mycobacterial infections. Cutaneous tuberculosis exhibits different clinical phenotypes acquired through different routes, including via extrinsic inoculation of the tuberculous bacilli and dissemination to the skin from other sites, or represents hypersensitivity reactions to M. tuberculosis infection. In many settings, leprosy remains an important cause of neurological impairment, deformity, limb loss, and stigma. Mycobacterium lepromatosis, a mycobacterial species related to M. leprae, is linked to diffuse lepromatous leprosy of Lucio and Latapí. Mycobacterium ulcerans produces a mycolactone toxin that leads to subcutaneous tissue destruction and immunosuppression, resulting in deep ulcerations that often produce substantial disfigurement and disability. Mycobacterium marinum, a close relative of M. ulcerans, is an important cause of cutaneous sporotrichoid nodular lymphangitic lesions. Among patients with advanced immunosuppression, Mycobacterium kansasii, the Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex, and Mycobacterium haemophilum may cause cutaneous or disseminated disease. Rapidly growing mycobacteria, including the Mycobacterium abscessus group, Mycobacterium chelonei, and Mycobacterium fortuitum, are increasingly recognized pathogens in cutaneous infections associated particularly with plastic surgery and cosmetic procedures. Skin biopsies of cutaneous lesions to identify acid-fast staining bacilli and cultures represent the cornerstone of diagnosis. Additionally, histopathological evaluation of skin biopsy specimens may be useful in identifying leprosy, Buruli ulcer, and cutaneous tuberculosis. Molecular assays are useful in some cases. The treatment for cutaneous mycobacterial infections depends on the specific pathogen and therefore requires a careful consideration of antimicrobial choices based on official treatment guidelines.\n",

New onset seizures during pregnancy and the postpartum can be attributed to several etiologies. Patient demographic data as well as personal and social histories are key in determining the etiology of new onset seizures. Neurocysticercosis (NCC), a commonly overlooked etiology, must be included in the differential diagnosis of patients with new onset seizures coming from NCC endemic areas. The diagnosis is based on a combination of clinical findings, exposure history, imaging, and serology. We present two cases of patients with NCC that became symptomatic during pregnancy or postpartum period. We will review the epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and management of NCC in pregnancy.\n",

Its prevalence is high in low-income and middle-income countries, and its incidence has increased in high-income countries in the last few decades among men who have sex with men. Syphilis is a major cause of adverse pregnancy outcomes in low-income and middle-income countries. Clinical features include a primary chancre at the point of inoculation, followed weeks later by the rash of secondary syphilis, a latent period, and in some cases, involvement of the eyes, CNS, and cardiovascular systems. It is diagnosed serologically. A single intramuscular dose of long-acting benzathine penicillin is recommended for people who have had syphilis for less than 1 year and longer courses for people with late latent syphilis. Control strategies include screening and treatment of all pregnant women, and targeted interventions for groups at high risk. Vaccine development, research on antibiotic prophylaxis, and digital messaging as prevention strategies are ongoing.\n",

            "Abstract: Multimorbidity (two or more coexisting conditions in an individual) is a growing global challenge with substantial effects on individuals, carers and society. Multimorbidity occurs a decade earlier in socioeconomically deprived communities and is associated with premature death, poorer function and quality of life and increased health-care utilization. Mechanisms underlying the development of multimorbidity are complex, interrelated and multilevel, but are related to ageing and underlying biological mechanisms and broader determinants of health such as socioeconomic deprivation. Little is known about prevention of multimorbidity, but focusing on psychosocial and behavioural factors, particularly population level interventions and structural changes, is likely to be beneficial. Most clinical practice guidelines and health-care training and delivery focus on single diseases, leading to care that is sometimes inadequate and potentially harmful. Multimorbidity requires person-centred care, prioritizing what matters most to the individual and the individual’s carers, ensuring care that is effectively coordinated and minimally disruptive, and aligns with the patient’s values. Interventions are likely to be complex and multifaceted. Although an increasing number of studies have examined multimorbidity interventions, there is still limited evidence to support any approach. Greater investment in multimorbidity research and training along with reconfiguration of health care supporting the management of multimorbidity is urgently needed.\n",

Hypoxia induces similar outcomes in other organs such as the lungs, kidney, and gut. Comparing and contrasting the effects of hypoxia on placental functions and functions of lung, kidney, and gut can lead to novel hypotheses and investigations, furthering our understanding of the impact of hypoxia on these diverse yet similar organs.

            "Abstract: The normal physiologic changes during pregnancy contribute to nutritional, metabolic, and immunologic adjustments, which can have an impact on the presentation of several diseases. New onset seizures during pregnancy and the postpartum can be attributed to several etiologies. Patient demographic data as well as personal and social histories are key in determining the etiology of new onset seizures. Neurocysticercosis (NCC), a commonly overlooked etiology, must be included in the differential diagnosis of patients with new onset seizures coming from NCC endemic areas. The diagnosis is based on a combination of clinical findings, exposure history, imaging, and serology. We present two cases of patients with NCC that became symptomatic during pregnancy or postpartum period. We will review the epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and management of NCC in pregnancy.\n",
