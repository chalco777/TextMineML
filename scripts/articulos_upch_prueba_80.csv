It is associated with fatigue, anxiety, depression, and functional capacity is greatly affected by the coexistence of these disorders. Methods: It is a series of cross-sectional cases, using secondary data from 126 patients with fibromyalgia who attended the outpatient clinic of a hospital at Lima at the rheumatology service during February 2020.We try to determine the frequency of functional disability and explore associated factors in patients diagnosed with fibromyalgia with or without depression. Functional capacity and the presence of depressive symptoms were measure by validated scales. A multivariate multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to assess whether depression is an independent risk factor for disability. Results: The age had a median of 53.5 (IQR: 46-60) years, 122 participants were women. In addition, 42 (33.33%) patients had depression and 76 (60.32%) patients had functional disability. In the multivariate analysis, it was found that depression is an independent risk factor for functional disability after adjusting for diabetes, presence of 3 or more comorbidities, intensity of fatigue and associated symptoms [OR 3.09 (1.24 - 7.70); p: 0.015]. Conclusions: Depression is an independent factor for functional incapacity in patients with fibromyalgia.Introducción: La fibromialgia es un trastorno reumatológico caracterizado por dolor generalizado de localización imprecisa que afecta principalmente a mujeres.

Experiencias de usarios y familiares sobre la atención recibida en centros de salud metal comunitaria de Lima y Callao durante la pandemia de la COVID-19,"Cusihuaman Lope, Noelia Margarita; Vilela Estrada, Ana Lucía; Cavero Huapaya, Victoria María; Villarreal-Zegarra, David; Diez-Canseco Montero, Francisco","Resumen:OBJECTIVE.: To understand the experiences of new and continuing users of Community Mental Health Centers (CMHC) of Lima and Callao, and their relatives, regarding the mental health care they received during the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS.: Qualitative study conducted between September 2021 and February 2022, in which we interviewed 24 users and family members who interacted with the services provided by three CMHCs in Lima and one in Callao during the COVID-19 pandemic. We carried out a thematic analysis of the transcribed interviews. RESULTS.: Participants perceived that the pandemic exacerbated the symptoms of people with mental health problems. During the pandemic, mental health care relied on the use of technology, mainly telephone calls, which were used to monitor the emotional state and pharmacological treatment of users, as well as to schedule and remember appointments. The users emphasized that frequent telephone calls made them feel accompanied and highlighted the commitment of the CMHC workers. Among the difficulties, they reported an increase in the demand for care, problems in accessing video calls, and low quality in virtual care. CONCLUSIONS.: COVID-19 had an emotional impact on people with mental health problems; in turn, CMHC services were affected by the type of care (face-to-face or virtual), resources, frequency, time and quality of care, finding limitations and benefits in the use of technology.OBJETIVOS.: Comprender las experiencias de usuarios nuevos y continuadores de los Centros de Salud Mental Comunitaria (CSMC) de Lima y Callao, y de sus familiares, en relación a la atención en salud mental que recibieron durante la pandemia de la COVID-19.

Desarrollo y validación de un método de suspensión basado en células vero par a la detección del virus Zika,"Popuche, Dina; Huaman, Alfredo; Loyola Sosa, Steev Orlando; Silva, María; Jenkins, Sarah A.; Guevara, Carolina","Resumen:OBJECTIVE.: To develop and validate a cell suspension method using Vero 76 cells for culturing Zika virus (ZIKV) based on infection of detached freshly seeded cells. MATERIAL AND METHODS.: Three different multiplicities of infection of ZIKV were used to develop and compare this novel method to the standard confluent cell monolayer method. In addition, we preliminary validated the cell suspension method using well-characterized ZIKV positive and negative clinical samples. The standard confluent cell monolayer method was used as the reference method, and viral isolation was confirmed by a ZIKV-specific RT-PCR. The sensitivity and its 95% confidence intervals for the cell suspension method were estimated. Also, a technical comparison of the cell suspension method against the cell monolayer method was performed. RESULTS.: Our findings suggested that both the viral load and replication of ZIKV were comparable between both monolayer- and suspension-infection methods. Although both methods were suitable for culturing and isolating ZIKV, the cell suspension method was easier, cheaper, and quicker as well as a sensitive isolation technique. The cell suspension method was significantly more sensitive in detecting Zika in inconclusive cases by RT-PCR, with a fourfold increase compared to the confluent cell monolayer method. CONCLUSION.: The cell suspension method has the potential to be an effective method for cultivating and isolating ZIKV and its application is potentially useful in both research and clinical settings.OBJETIVO: Desarrollar y validar un método de suspensión celular utilizando células Vero 76 para el cultivo del virus Zika (ZIKV) basado en la infección de células recién sembradas no adheridas. MATERIAL Y MÉTODOS: . Se utilizaron tres multiplicidades de infección diferentes del ZIKV para desarrollar y comparar este novedoso método con el método estándar de monocapa de células confluentes. Además, validamos preliminarmente el método de suspensión utilizando muestras clínicas caracterizadas como positivas o negativas para el ZIKV. El método estándar de monocapa se utilizó como método de referencia, y el aislamiento viral se confirmó mediante un RT-PCR específico del ZIKV. Se estimó la sensibilidad e intervalos de confianza del 95% para el método de suspensión. Asimismo, se realizó una comparación técnica del método de suspensión contra el método de monocapa. RESULTADOS: . Nuestros hallazgos sugieren que tanto la carga viral como la replicación del ZIKV fueron comparables entre los métodos de infección en monocapa y en suspensión. Aunque ambos métodos fueron adecuados para cultivar y aislar el ZIKV, el método de suspensión se caracterizó por ser más fácil, barato y rápido, así como una técnica de aislamiento sensible. En comparación con el método de monocapa, el método de suspensión fue cuatro veces más sensible en la detección del ZIKV en casos inconclusos por RT-PCR. CONCLUSIONES: . El método de suspensión tiene el potencial de ser un método eficaz para cultivar y aislar el ZIKV y su uso es potencialmente útil tanto en la investigación como en entornos clínicos.","Instituto Nacional de Salud, Perú",2023,https://repositorio.upch.edu.pe/handle/20.500.12866/14734

The complete mitochondrial genome of the lowland paca (Cuniculus paca) and its phylogenetic relationship with other New World hystricognath rodents,"Li, J.; Mayor, P.; Santolalla Robles, Meddly Leslye; Greenwood, A.D.","Resumen:The lowland paca (Cuniculus paca) is a nocturnal, widespread, and solitary large-sized rodent in the family Cuniculidae, and one of the most frequently hunted mammals in the Neotropical forests of Latin America. We assembled the first complete mitochondrial genome of lowland paca using three closely related hystricognath species as reference sequences. The mitochondrial genome is 16,770 basepairs (bp) in length, with similar characteristics of vertebrate mitochondrial genomes. We performed phylogenetic analyses using 26 mitochondrial genome of hystricognath species based on thirteen protein-coding genes. The result confirms the taxonomical placement among the New World hystricognath rodents with high support. The placement is consistent with previous phylogenetic studies based on individual mitochondrial and nuclear genes.

Political and socioeconomic factors that shaped health taxes implementation in Peru,"Zuleta, Mario; Pérez León Quinoso, Silvana Patricia; Mialon, Melissa; Delgado-Zegarra, Jaime","Resumen:Background In 2016 and 2018, the Peruvian Ministry of Economy and Finance (MoEF) significantly reformulated taxes on tobacco products, alcohol and sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs). During these processes, different actors advanced arguments supporting or opposing the taxes. This study examines Peru's political and socioeconomic factors, the role of other actors and framing strategies, shaping health taxes introduction. Methods We conducted qualitative analysis by collecting information from three sources, such as: (1) media material (n=343 documents), (2) government documents (n=34) and (3) semistructured interviews (n=11). That data allowed us to identify and characterise the actors involved in implementing health taxes in Peru. We combined the data from these sources, synthesised our findings and conducted a stakeholder analysis. Results Key actors supporting taxes were the MoEF and civil society organisations, while trade associations and the alcohol, SSBs and tobacco industries opposed them using economic, trade-related arguments and criticised the policy process. The supporting group used arguments related to the economy and health to legitimate its narrative. The framing strategies employed by these stakeholders shaped and determined the outcome of the policy process. Conclusion Peruvian stakeholders against health taxes demonstrated a strong capacity to convey their messages to the media and high-level policy-makers. Despite these efforts, attempts to interfere with health taxes were unsuccessful in 2016 and 2018 and failed to overcome state institutions, particularly the MoEF. Strong institutions and individual decision-makers in Peru also contributed to the successful implementation of health taxes in Peru in 2016 and 2018.",BMJ Publishing Group,2023,https://repositorio.upch.edu.pe/handle/20.500.12866/14718

Jaime; Nugent, Rachel; Owolabi, Mayowa; Sullivan, Richard; Virani, Salim S.; Reddy, K. Srinath","Resumen:Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) have a remarkably high burden globally, accounting for 74% of all deaths. Every year 17 million people die from an NCD before the age of 70, and 86% of these premature deaths occur in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). The World Health Assembly endorsed the Global Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of NCDs 2013–2020 (NCD-GAP), now extended to 2030, to provide member states, international partners and the WHO with the tools, knowledge and policy options to reduce the impact of NCDs. The NCD-GAP includes a specific objective relating to research for NCD prevention and control, however the midpoint evaluation for the NCD-GAP, published in 2020, found that ‘overwhelmingly, research has been the weakest NCD-GAP objective in terms of implementation. Progress towards the NCD-GAP and United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) targets has been slow and hugely disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, with only a handful of countries on-track to reach SDG target 3.4—a one-third reduction in premature mortality from NCDs through prevention and treatment by 2030...",BMJ Publishing Group,2023,https://repositorio.upch.edu.pe/handle/20.500.12866/14725
Stellate Ganglion Block in Subarachnoid Hemorrhage: A Promising Protective Measure against Vasospasm?,"de Barros Oliveira, Leonardo; Batista, Sávio; Prestes, Milena Zadra; Bocanegra Becerra, Jhon Ernesto; Rabelo, Nicollas Nunes; Bertani, Raphael; Welling, Leonardo Christiaan; Figueiredo, Eberval Gadelha","Resumen:BACKGROUND: Stellate ganglion block (SGB) may have protective effects in patients at risk of vasospasm following subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) due to reduced  sympathetic activity. However, the safety and clinical outcomes of SGB in this  scenario are not definitively known. The objective was to evaluate the safety,  clinical outcomes, and cerebral blood flow velocity in patients submitted to SGB  or cervical sympathectomy with SAH. METHODS: Following PRISMA guidelines, a  systematic review and meta-analysis of studies investigating SGB or cervical  sympathectomy use in SAH were conducted. PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Embase  were evaluated. Patients with mRS from 0 to 2, GOS from 4 to 5, or symptom  resolution were considered favorable clinical outcomes. Related mortality was  defined as death by vasospasm or delayed cerebral ischemia. RESULTS: The analysis  included eight studies comprising 182 patients. Only two studies employed SGB  prophylactically. The results revealed favorable outcomes in 52% of patients (95%  CI: 37% - 65%). The overall incidence of complications was 2% (95% CI: 0% - 26%).  The mortality rate was 13% (95% CI: 7% - 21%), with a vasospasm-related mortality  rate of 11% (95% CI: 2% - 20%). A decrease of cerebral blood flow velocity was  reported in four studies. CONCLUSION: The notable reduction in CBFV following  SGB, alongside positive outcomes and a low occurrence of mortality and  complications, highlights its significance as a therapeutic intervention for  vasospasm following SAH. While the number of studies evaluating SGB as a  preventive measure is limited, the promising results emphasize the importance of  future research.",Elsevier,2023,https://repositorio.upch.edu.pe/handle/20.500.12866/14724
Systematic Review on Methods for Detection and Diagnosis of Diabetic Retinopathy from the Year 2013 to 2023,"Ramos-Cosi, S.; Coquis-Flames, J.; Cieza Terrones, Michael Javier; Llulluy-Nuñez, D.; Alva- Mantari, A.","Resumen:Diabetes is an illness that causes a multiple number of complications, Diabetic Retinopathy being one of them. The high level of glucose in the bloodstream eventually causes damage to the blood vessels and narrowing, including the small blood vessels in the eyes. If left unattended, this causes changes in the retina, and it can affect vision and lead to blindness. The present study was conducted to review the most predominant methods of detection and diagnosis of Diabetic Retinopathy from the years 2013 to 2023. The selection of the documents was done using the Scopus database, and the data gathered was then processed using RStudio and Google Collaborate. After processing the 9610 documents that were gathered, it was shown that with the technological advancements in recent years, new ideas and ways of detecting and diagnosing diabetic retinopathy have been developed. These include ways to get images of the fundus of the eye and process them more efficiently through methods like the use of artificial intelligence or neural networks and deep learning, the construction of hardware using microcontrollers and the use of smartphone cameras to capture the image in order to lower the costs. The use of artificial intelligence for image processing is most dominant in current trends, but the work on the development of new hardware built for image capture is not as numerous in comparison.",Seventh Sense Research Group,2023,https://repositorio.upch.edu.pe/handle/20.500.12866/14727

Quantifying its burden in the WHO Region of the Americas has been elusive-despite the region's long history of resistance surveillance. This study provides comprehensive estimates of AMR burden in the Americas to assess this growing health threat.Methods Weestimated deaths and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) attributable to and associated with AMR for 23 bacterial pathogens and 88 pathogen-drug combinations for countries in the WHO Region of the Americas in 2019. We obtained data from mortality registries, surveillance systems, hospital systems, systematic literature reviews, and other sources, and applied predictive statistical modelling to produce estimates of AMR burden for all countries in the Americas. Five broad components were the backbone of our approach: the number of deaths where infection had a role, the proportion of infectious deaths attributable to a given infectious syndrome, the proportion of infectious syndrome deaths attributable to a given pathogen, the percentage of pathogens resistant to an antibiotic class, and the excess risk of mortality (or duration of an infection) associated with this resistance. We then used these components to estimate the disease burden by applying two counterfactual scenarios: deaths attributable to AMR (compared to an alternative scenario where resistant infections are replaced with susceptible ones), and deaths associated with AMR (compared to an alternative scenario where resistant infections would not occur at all). We generated 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) for final estimates as the 25th and 975th ordered values across 1000 posterior draws, and models were cross-validated for out-of-sample predictive validity. Findings We estimated 569,000 deaths (95% UI 406,000-771,000) associated with bacterial AMR and 141,000 deaths (99,900-196,000) attributable to bacterial AMR among the 35 countries in the WHO Region of the Americas in 2019. Lower respiratory and thorax infections, as a syndrome, were responsible for the largest fatal burden of AMR in the region, with 189,000 deaths (149,000-241,000) associated with resistance, followed by bloodstream infections (169,000 deaths [94,200-278,000]) and peritoneal/intra-abdominal infections (118,000 deaths [78,600-168,000]). The six leading pathogens (by order of number of deaths associated with resistance) were Staphylococcus aureus , Escherichia coli , Klebsiella pneumoniae , Streptococcus pneumoniae , Pseudomonas aeruginosa , and Acinetobacter baumannii. Together, these pathogens were responsible for 452,000 deaths (326,000-608,000) associated with AMR. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus predominated as the leading pathogen-drug combination in 34 countries for deaths attributable to AMR, while aminopenicillin-resistant E. coli was the leading pathogen-drug combination in 15 countries for deaths associated with AMR. Interpretation Given the burden across different countries, infectious syndromes, and pathogen-drug combinations, AMR represents a substantial health threat in the Americas. Countries with low access to antibiotics and basic health-care services often face the largest age-standardised mortality rates associated with and attributable to AMR in the region, implicating specific policy interventions. Evidence from this study can guide mitigation efforts that are tailored to the needs of each country in the region while informing decisions regarding funding and resource allocation. Multisectoral and joint cooperative efforts among countries will be a key to success in tackling AMR in the Americas.",Elsevier,2023,https://repositorio.upch.edu.pe/handle/20.500.12866/14729
"Prevalence, awareness, treatment and control of high blood pressure in a cohort in Northern Andean Peru.","Sanchez-Samaniego, Giuliana; Hartinger Peña, Stella Maria; Mäusezahl, Daniel; Hattendorf, Jan; Fink, Günther; Probst-Hensch, Nicole","Resumen:BACKGROUND: Gaps exist along the high blood pressure (HBP) diagnosis-treatment-control pathway in high, low and middle-income countries.  OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of HBP and to describe the levels of  awareness, control and treatment of HBP in the rural Peruvian Andes. METHODS:  This cross-sectional study is embedded into a multigenerational cohort. We  analysed data of all adult participants aged ≥ 30 years (n = 2752) who answered a  baseline health and lifestyle questionnaire and underwent a physical examination,  which included three blood pressure readings. HBP was defined as measured  systolic or diastolic blood pressure (BP) ≥140 and/or 90 mm Hg and/or  self-reported physician-diagnosed hypertension and/or self-reported  antihypertensive intake. The determinants of the prevalence of HBP, unawareness  of HBP and uncontrolled HBP were assessed using mixed-effect logistic  regressions. RESULTS: HBP was present in 18.9% of the participants. Of those with  measured HBP, 72.2% were unaware of their HBP. Among those with a diagnosed or  medically treated hypertension, 58.4% had uncontrolled HBP. The prevalence of HBP  was higher in women (OR: 1.12, CI: 1.02-1.24), increased with age (OR: 1.01, CI:  1.01-1.01) and the presence of family history of hypertension (OR: 1.15, CI:  1.08-1.24), and decreased with healthier lifestyle score (OR: 0.93, CI:  0.91-0.95). Unawareness of HBP was lower among women (OR: 0.56, CI: 0.38-0.83),  higher among participants living over 3000 m Above Sea Level (OR: 1.15, CI:  1.03-1.27) and decreased with age (OR: 0.99, CI: 0.98-0.99). CONCLUSIONS:  Unawareness of HBP was high, few HTN patients received treatment and BP remained  high in the presence of antihypertensive treatment.",Taylor and Francis,2023,https://repositorio.upch.edu.pe/handle/20.500.12866/14719
Sensitivity and specificity of the ICDAS II system and bitewing radiographs for detecting occlusal caries using the Spectra™ caries detection system as the reference test in children,"Caceda, Jorge H.; Jiang, Shuying; Calderón Ubaqui, Victor; Villavicencio Caparo, Ebigen","Resumen:Background: Most studies assessing the sensitivity and specificity of caries detection methods have been performed in vitro using the histological method as the gold standard showing inconsistent values. The aim of this study was to compare the sensitivity and specificity in detecting occlusal caries using the International Caries Detection and Assessment System (ICDAS II) with the radiographic method (RM), while using the Spectra™ Caries Detection System (SCDS) as the reference test. Methods: One hundred sixty children, ages 7–12 years, participated in the study. Five zones in the occlusal surfaces of 859 primary and 632 first permanent molars were examined visually using ICDAS-II, the RM using bitewing radiographs and SCDS. The descriptive statistics of sensitivity and specificity were calculated and compared. Results: For all molars combined and for primary molars only, the sensitivity of ICDAS II was higher for detecting total caries (p < 0.001), caries in enamel (p < 0.001), and caries in dentin (p = 0.016), but it was not different for detecting caries in the dentin of permanent first molars (p = 0.214), and primary second molars (p = 0.761). The specificity of RM was higher for detecting total caries, caries in enamel for all molars combined and for permanent first molars (p < 0.001). For caries in dentin, the specificity of ICDAS II was higher for all molars combined and for primary molars only (p < 0.001). For total caries in primary molars only, and caries in dentin of permanent first molars only, the specificity was not different (p = 0.156 and p = 0.181 respectively). Conclusions: The sensitivity and specificity of ICDAS II and RM changes depending on whether the carious lesion compromises the enamel or dentin, and if the caries detection is performed in the primary molars or permanent first molars.",BioMed Central,2023,https://repositorio.upch.edu.pe/handle/20.500.12866/14720

However, the impact of PCVs  introduction may be affected by the serotype distribution in a specific context.  METHODS: Cross-sectional multicenter passive surveillance study of IPD cases in  pediatric patients hospitalized in Lima, Peru between 2016 and 2019 (after PCV13  introduction) to determine the serotype distribution and antimicrobial resistance  of Streptococcus pneumoniae. Serotyping was performed by a sequential multiplex  PCR and confirmed by whole genome sequencing. RESULTS: Eighty-five S. pneumoniae  isolates were recovered (4.07/100,000 among children <60 months of age). Serotype  19A was the most common (49.4%). Children infected with serotype 19A in  comparison with children infected with other serotypes were younger, had a lower  rate of meningitis and higher rates of pneumonia, complicated pneumonia and  antimicrobial resistance; 28.6% of patients with serotype 19A have received at  least one dose of PCV13 vs. 62.8% of patients with other serotypes. Using  MIC-breakpoints, 81.2% (56/69) of non-meningitis strains and 31.2% (5/16) of  meningitis strains were susceptible to penicillin; 18.8% (3/16) of meningitis  strains had intermediate resistance to ceftriaxone. Resistance to azithromycin  was 78.8% (67/85). Serotype 19A frequency increased over time in the same study  population, from 4.2% (4/96) in 2006-2008, to 8.6% (5/58) in 2009-2011, to 49.4%  (42/85) in the current study (2016-2019) (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: After PCV13  introduction in Peru, serotype 19A remains the most prevalent; however, the  vaccination coverage is still not optimal. Therefore, additonal surveillance studies are needed to determine the remaining IPD burden.",Elsevier,2023,https://repositorio.upch.edu.pe/handle/20.500.12866/14726

"Sodium content in commonly consumed away-from-home food in three areas of Metropolitan Lima, Peru.","Meza Hernandez, Mayra Milagros; Duran Galdo, Rafael Federico; Torres Schiaffino, Daniella; Saavedra Garcia, Lorena Maria","Resumen:The aim of this study was to characterize the sodium content in commonly consumed away-from-home food in three areas of Metropolitan Lima. We conducted a  cross-sectional study, in which twenty frequently consumed foods were identified  according to the place of sale. Sodium content was determined through atomic  absorption spectroscopy in preparations collected in 2019. The median sodium  content in street food products was 492.36 mg/100g (IQR: 83.93 - 918.78), 471.37  mg/100 g in artisanal food (IQR: 76.04 - 765.39) and 471.06 mg/100 g in fast food  (IQR: 115.31 - 695.18). Sixty-five percent of the foods were classified as having  high sodium content according to Peruvian regulations, while 30% of the  preparations had high sodium content, according to UK parameters. Most food sold  and consumed away from home have high sodium content. It is essential to engage  all stakeholders involved in food preparation for away-from-home consumption in  order to raise awareness and involve them in the promotion of policies aimed at  reducing sodium intake.","Instituto Nacional de Salud, Perú",2023,https://repositorio.upch.edu.pe/handle/20.500.12866/14722

Incorporating environmental heterogeneity and observation effort to predict host distribution and viral spillover from a bat reservoir,"Ribeiro, Rita; Matthiopoulos, Jason; Lindgren, Finn; Tello, Carlos; Zariquiey, Carlos M.; Valderrama Bazán, William David; Rocke, Tonie E.; Streicker, Daniel G.","Resumen:Predicting the spatial occurrence of wildlife is a major challenge for ecology and management. In Latin America, limited knowledge of the number and locations of vampire bat roosts precludes informed allocation of measures intended to prevent rabies spillover to humans and livestock. We inferred the spatial distribution of vampire bat roosts while accounting for observation effort and environmental effects by fitting a log Gaussian Cox process model to the locations of 563 roosts in three regions of Peru. Our model explained 45% of the variance in the observed roost distribution and identified environmental drivers of roost establishment. When correcting for uneven observation effort, our model estimated a total of 2340 roosts, indicating that undetected roosts (76%) exceed known roosts (24%) by threefold. Predicted hotspots of undetected roosts in rabies-free areas revealed high-risk areas for future viral incursions. Using the predicted roost distribution to inform a spatial model of rabies spillover to livestock identified areas with disproportionate underreporting and indicated a higher rabies burden than previously recognized. We provide a transferrable approach to infer the distribution of a mostly unobserved bat reservoir that can inform strategies to prevent the re-emergence of an important zoonosis.",Royal Society Publishing,2023,https://repositorio.upch.edu.pe/handle/20.500.12866/14711

When leveraging routine care data for observational research, developing audit protocols that can maximize informational return and minimize costs is paramount. Methods: For more than a decade, the Latin America and East Africa regions of the International epidemiology Databases to Evaluate AIDS (IeDEA) consortium have been auditing the observational data drawn from participating HIV clinics. Since our earliest audits, where external auditors used paper forms to record audit findings from paper medical records, we have streamlined our protocols to obtain more efficient and informative audits that keep up with advancing technology while reducing travel obligations and associated costs. Results: We present five key lessons learned from conducting data audits of secondary use data from resource-limited settings for more than 10 years and share eight recommendations for other consortia looking to implement data quality initiatives. Conclusion: After completing multiple audit cycles in both the Latin America and East Africa regions of the IeDEA consortium, we have established a rich reference for data quality in our cohorts, as well as large, audited analytical datasets that can be used to answer important clinical questions with confidence. By sharing our audit processes and how they have been adapted over time, we hope that others can develop protocols informed by our lessons learned from more than a decade of experience in these large, diverse cohorts.",Cambridge University Press,2023,https://repositorio.upch.edu.pe/handle/20.500.12866/14713
Nutritional and bioactive properties of Solanum quitoense lam: native fruit from the south american andes,"Obregón, AJ; López, MD; Angeles Romero, Diego","Resumen:The increasing interest in tropical fruits has been observed worldwide, driven by their desirable sensory and nutritional characteristics. Lulo (Solanum quitoense L.), an exotic and native South American fruit, is predominantly used in beverage production and commercially marketed in Colombia and Ecuador. However, the perishable nature presents challenges for their commercialization to market. This has prompted food researchers to be interested in developing new Lulo-based products, that can have an agro-industrial impact in the countries of origin. Lately, a growing number of studies have aimed to uncover the nutritional and bioactive properties of Lulo. These studies have revealed that the fruit is rich in vitamin C, chlorogenic acids, phenolic compounds, and bioactive amines, making it an attractive raw material for the agri-food and pharmaceutical industries. This review summarizes the current understanding of the properties of Solanum quitoense L., including its physicochemical, nutritional, and bioactive properties. The fruit's high concentration of beneficial compounds has increased interest from industries and presents new opportunities for economic growth in the countries where it is grown. The growing demand for natural products underscores the need for further research on Lulo's potential applications and benefits, which could result in the development of new and economically viable products.",Slovenská Poľnohospodárska Univerzita v Nitre,2023,https://repositorio.upch.edu.pe/handle/20.500.12866/14714
Justice implications of health and food security policies for Indigenous peoples facing COVID-19: a qualitative study and policy analysis in Peru,"Chicmana Zapata, Victoria del Pilar; Arotoma-Rojas, Ingrid; Anza Ramírez, Cecilia Isabel; Ford, James; Galappaththi, Eranga K.; Pickering, Kerrie; Sacks, Emma; Togarepi, Cecil; Perera, Chrishma D.; van Bavel, Bianca; Hyams, Keith; Akugre, Francis A.; Nkalubo, Jonathan; Dharmasiri, Indunil; Nakwafila, Olivia; Mensah, Adelina; Miranda, J. Jaime; Zavaleta-Cortijo, Carol","Resumen:The spread of COVID-19 in Peru resulted in the declaration of a national health emergency, in which Indigenous peoples were identified as being particularly vulnerable due to their pre-existing poor health indicators and disadvantaged social conditions. The aim of this paper is to examine how the Peruvian government responded to the health and food needs of the Shawi and Ashaninka Indigenous peoples of Peru during the first 18 months of the pandemic (March 2020-August 2021). This study uses both official policy documents and real-world experiences to evaluate policy responses in terms of their immediate impact and their longer-term sustainability and contribution to the improvement of health, well-being and justice for Indigenous communities. Four health and food security responses were evaluated: the Amazon Health Plan and Indigenous Command; food aid; cash aid; and COVID-19 vaccination. We employed the Multidimensional Injustice Framework to analyse the justice implications of the design and implementation of responses. Data collection included 71 interviews with government officials (n = 7), Indigenous leaders (n = 31) and community members (n = 33). The results show how national and regional governments released policies to address the health and food needs of Indigenous peoples directly or indirectly, as part of a broader focus on vulnerable people. However, justice implications were not sufficiently addressed in the design or implementation of the responses. On the distributive dimension, Indigenous communities were prioritized to receive health goods and services, nevertheless, the distribution had shortcomings that impeded their collection and Indigenous food systems and livelihoods were largely overlooked. On the procedural dimension, Indigenous representatives were included to provide culturally sensitive feedback on health interventions, but without funding, and furthermore, the community members had only passive participation. This paper points out the importance of considering and addressing justice implications for more effective and fairer health and food policy responses to current and future health crises.",Oxford University Press,2023,https://repositorio.upch.edu.pe/handle/20.500.12866/14712
"Pneumonia Mortality Trends in Children under 5 Years of Age in the Context of Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccination in Peru, 2003-2017.","Sanchez, Carlos A.; Lozada-Urbano, Michelle; Best Bandenay, Pablo Yvan","Resumen:Worldwide, conjugated pneumococcal vaccines (PCVs) have proven effective against invasive pneumococcal disease, but non-invasive pneumonia is a major cause of  mortality in young children and serotypes vary geographically, affecting  effectiveness. We analyze nationwide death certificate data between 2003-2017 to  assess the impact of PCVs on pneumonia mortality among young children from Peru.  We report descriptive statistics and perform timeseries analysis on annual  mortality rates (AMRs) and monthly frequencies of pneumonia deaths. Children  under 5 years of age accounted for 6.2% (n = 10,408) of all pneumonia deaths (N =  166,844), and 32.3% (n = 3363) were children between 1-4 years of age, of which  95.1% did not report pneumonia etiology. Comparing periods before and after PCV  introduction in 2009, mean AMRs dropped 13.5% and 26.0% for children between 1-4  years of age (toddlers/preschoolers), and children under 1 year of age (infants),  respectively. A moderate correlation (Spearman's r = 0.546, p < 0.01) in the  monthly frequency of pneumonia deaths was estimated between both age groups.  Quadratic regression suggests a change in direction around 2005 (highest  pneumonia mortality) for both age groups, but percentage change analysis  identified an inflection point in 2013 for infants only, not for  toddlers/preschoolers, suggesting that the impact of PCVs might be different for  each age group.",MDPI,2023,https://repositorio.upch.edu.pe/handle/20.500.12866/14717

Specific mental health policies were therefore implemented to mitigate the potential mental health impact of the pandemic. We aimed to explore the implementation of mental health regulations adopted by the Peruvian health system by focusing on the care services at Community Mental Health Centres (CMHCs), based on the experiences of health workers. We conducted a phenomenological qualitative study to understand the implementation of mental health policies launched in Peru during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data were obtained from a document review of 15 national policy measures implemented during the pandemic (March 2020 to September 2021), and 20 interviews with health workers from CMHCs (September 2021 to February 2022). The analysis was conducted using thematic content analysis. Most implemented policies adapted CMHC care services to a virtual modality during the COVID-19 pandemic; however, various challenges and barriers were evidenced in the process, which prevented effective adaptation of services. Workers perceived that ineffective telemedicine use was attributed to a gap in access to technology at the CMHCs and also by users, ranging from limited access to technological devices to a lack of technological skills. Further, although mental health promotion and prevention policies targeting the community were proposed, CMHC staff reported temporary interruption of these services during the first wave. The disparity between what is stated in the regulations and the experiences of health workers is evident. Policies that focus on mental health need to provide practical and flexible methods taking into consideration both the needs of CMHCs and socio-cultural characteristics that may affect their implementation.",Oxford University Press,2023,https://repositorio.upch.edu.pe/handle/20.500.12866/14716
Ongoing Healthcare Disparities in neuroHIV: Addressing Gaps in the Care Continuum.,"Jia, Dan Tong; Cárcamo García, Paloma Mariana; Diaz, Monica M.","Resumen:PURPOSE OF REVIEW: We aim to review the neurological complications of HIV and the social, cultural, and economic inequalities that contribute to disparities in  neuroHIV care. RECENT FINDINGS: Disparities in diagnostics and care of patients  with neurological infections and non-infectious conditions associated with HIV in  both high-income and low-to-middle-income countries (LMIC) are common. The  COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated these disparities. Factors, such as HIV-related  stigma, may deter people from accessing HIV treatment. First-line recommended  treatments for neurological infections are not available in many LMICs, leading  to inadequate treatment and exposure to agents with more harmful side effect  profiles. Access-related factors, such as lack of transportation, lack of health  insurance, and inadequate telehealth access, may increase the risk of HIV-related  neurological complications. Further research is needed to increase awareness of  neurological complications among providers and PWH, and regional guidelines  should be considered to better address these complications.",Springer,2023,https://repositorio.upch.edu.pe/handle/20.500.12866/14715

We used data from 117 population-based studies and quantified, in different world regions, the prevalence of diagnosed diabetes, and whether those who were previously undiagnosed and detected as having diabetes in survey screening, had elevated FPG, HbA1c or both. We developed prediction equations for estimating the probability that a person without previously diagnosed diabetes, and at a specific level of FPG, had elevated HbA1c, and vice versa. The age-standardized proportion of diabetes that was previously undiagnosed and detected in survey screening ranged from 30% in the high-income western region to 66% in south Asia. Among those with screen-detected diabetes with either test, the age-standardized proportion who had elevated levels of both FPG and HbA1c was 29–39% across regions; the remainder had discordant elevation of FPG or HbA1c. In most low- and middle-income regions, isolated elevated HbA1c was more common than isolated elevated FPG. In these regions, the use of FPG alone may delay diabetes diagnosis and underestimate diabetes prevalence. Our prediction equations help allocate finite resources for measuring HbA1c to reduce the global shortfall in diabetes diagnosis and surveillance.",Nature Research,2023,https://repositorio.upch.edu.pe/handle/20.500.12866/14709
“We usually see a lot of delay in terms of coming for or seeking care”: an expert consultation on COVID testing and care pathways in seven low- and middle-income countries,"Bonnet, Gabrielle; Bimba, John; Chavula, Chancy; Chifamba, Harunavamwe N.; Divala, Titus; Lescano Guevara, Andres Guillermo; Majam, Mohammed; Mbo, Danjuma; Suwantika, Auliya A.; Tovar, Marco A.; Yadav, Pragya; Corbett, Elisabeth L.; Vassall, Anna; Jit, Mark","Resumen:Background: Rapid diagnostic testing may support improved treatment of COVID patients. Understanding COVID testing and care pathways is important for assessing the impact and cost-effectiveness of testing in the real world, yet there is limited information on these pathways in low-and-middle income countries (LMICs). We therefore undertook an expert consultation to better understand testing policies and practices, clinical screening, the profile of patients seeking testing or care, linkage to care after testing, treatment, lessons learnt and expected changes in 2023. Methods: We organized a qualitative consultation with ten experts from seven LMICs (India, Indonesia, Malawi, Nigeria, Peru, South Africa, and Zimbabwe) identified through purposive sampling. We conducted structured interviews during six regional consultations, and undertook a thematic analysis of responses. Results: Participants reported that, after initial efforts to scale-up testing, the policy priority given to COVID testing has declined. Comorbidities putting patients at heightened risk (e.g., diabetes) mainly relied on self-identification. The decision to test following clinical screening was highly context-/location-specific, often dictated by local epidemiology and test availability. When rapid diagnostic tests were available, public sector healthcare providers tended to rely on them for diagnosis (alongside PCR for Asian/Latin American participants), while private sector providers predominantly used polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests. Positive test results were generally taken at ‘face value’ by clinicians, although negative tests with a high index of suspicion may be confirmed with PCR. However, even with a positive result, patients were not always linked to care in a timely manner because of reluctance to receiving care or delays in returning to care centres upon clinical deterioration. Countries often lacked multiple components of the range of therapeutics advised in WHO guidelines: notably so for oral antivirals designed for high-risk mild patients. Severely ill patients mostly received corticosteroids and, in higher-resourced settings, tocilizumab. Conclusions: Testing does not always prompt enhanced care, due to reluctance on the part of patients and limited therapeutic availability within clinical settings. Any analysis of the impact or cost-effectiveness of testing policies post pandemic needs to either consider investment in optimal treatment pathways or constrain estimates of benefits based on actual practice.",BioMed Central,2023,https://repositorio.upch.edu.pe/handle/20.500.12866/14698
A new Plasmodium vivax reference genome for South American isolates,"De Meulenaere, Katlijn; Cuypers, Bart; Gamboa Vilela, Dionicia Baziliza; Laukens, Kris; Rosanas-Urgell, Anna","Resumen:Background: Plasmodium vivax is the second most important cause of human malaria worldwide, and accounts for the majority of malaria cases in South America. A high-quality reference genome exists for Papua Indonesia (PvP01) and Thailand (PvW1), but is lacking for South America. A reference genome specifically for South America would be beneficial though, as P. vivax is a genetically diverse parasite with geographical clustering. Results: This study presents a new high-quality assembly of a South American P. vivax isolate, referred to as PvPAM (P. vivax Peruvian AMazon). The genome was obtained from a low input patient sample from the Peruvian Amazon and sequenced using PacBio technology, resulting in a highly complete assembly with 6497 functional genes. Telomeric ends were present in 17 out of 28 chromosomal ends, and additional (sub)telomeric regions are present in 12 unassigned contigs. A comparison of multigene families between PvPAM and the PvP01 genome revealed remarkable variation in vir genes, and the presence of merozoite surface proteins (MSP) 3.6 and 3.7. Three dhfr and dhps drug resistance associated mutations are present in PvPAM, similar to those found in other Peruvian isolates. Mapping of publicly available South American whole genome sequencing (WGS) data to PvPAM resulted in significantly fewer variants and truncated reads compared to the use of PvP01 or PvW1 as reference genomes. To minimize the number of core genome variants in non-South American samples, PvW1 is most suited for Southeast Asian isolates, both PvPAM and PvW1 are suited for South Asian isolates, and PvPAM is recommended for African isolates. Interestingly, non-South American samples still contained the least subtelomeric variants when mapped to PvPAM, indicating high quality of the PvPAM subtelomeric regions. Conclusions: Our findings show that the PvPAM reference genome more accurately represents South American P. vivax isolates in comparison to PvP01 and PvW1. In addition, PvPAM has a high level of completeness, and contains a similar number of annotated genes as PvP01 or PvW1. The PvPAM genome therefore will be a valuable resource to improve future genomic analyses on P. vivax isolates from the South American continent.",BioMed Central,2023,https://repositorio.upch.edu.pe/handle/20.500.12866/14699
An unusual case of Candida parapsilosis endocarditis of the native tricuspid valve secondary to a tunneled dialysis catheter.,"Zacarías Mendoza, Nathalie Victoria; Zevallos Goyzueta, Andrea Verónica; Wu Chen, Alexander; Robles Velarde, Víctor Justo","Resumen:Candida endocarditis is a severe disease associated with high mortality rates. Candida parapsilosis is frequently identified as the causative pathogen in  intravenous drug users and is commonly associated with nosocomial infections,  primarily due to its ability to form biofilms on catheters or other foreign  bodies. Here, we present a rare case of Candida parapsilosis endocarditis  affecting the native tricuspid valve in a 35-year-old male patient with end-stage  chronic kidney disease (Stage V), who had a suspected fungal infection related to  the left cervical catheter. The patient received treatment with caspofungin and  underwent excision of a verrucous tumor on the tricuspid valve. Despite  encountering postoperative complications, the patient was discharged on  fluconazole treatment and scheduled for follow-up. Candida endocarditis poses a  clinical challenge that necessitates a multidisciplinary approach and tailored  management due to its infrequent occurrence and higher mortality rate compared to  bacterial endocarditis.",Instituto Nacional Cardiovascular,2023,https://repositorio.upch.edu.pe/handle/20.500.12866/14700
Association Between Chronic Diseases and Need for Dental Treatment in a Stomatology of Special Patients Service,"Abanto Silva, Lillie Elizabeth; López Torres, Ana Cristina; Garcés Elías, María Claudia; Leon Manco, Roberto Antonio","Resumen:Aim: To determine the association between chronic diseases (CD) and the need for dental treatment in patients of the stomatology of special patients service (SSPS) of the Teaching Dental Center (TDC) of Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia (UPCH) in Lima-Peru from 2016 to 2019. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study with a total population of 2024 digital medical records of individuals over 18 years old. A dependent variable was need for dental treatment, so an instrument to assess it was created; additionally, the presence of CD was evaluated. Other covariates considered were pharmacological treatment, last dental visit, provenance, age group, and sex. Statistical analyses were performed, including a bivariate analysis using the Chi-square test. Finally, a Poisson linear regression was performed to determine crude and adjusted prevalence ratios (aPR) with the variables showing associations, with a 95% confidence level (95%CI) and a p <.05 value. Results: The need for low-complexity dental treatment was present in 2.62% (n = 52) of patients, moderate complexity in 27.21% (n = 541) of patients, and high complexity in 70.17% (n = 1395) of patients. In relation to CD, 30.58% (n = 608) had one, 31.39% (n = 624) had two, and 38.03% (n = 756) had three or more. In the multivariate analysis, the presence of three to more CD and the need for high-complexity vs. low-complexity treatment, an aPR of 1.02 (95%CI): 1.01–1.04; p =.019) was obtained. Conclusion: There is a positive association between the presence of three or more CD and the need for high complexity dental treatment compared to low-complexity dental treatment, adjusted for use of pharmacological treatment and age.",SAGE Publications,2023,https://repositorio.upch.edu.pe/handle/20.500.12866/14702
Call for emergency action to restore dietary diversity and protect global food systems in times of COVID-19 and beyond: Results from a cross-sectional study in 38 countries,"Hoteit, Maha; Hoteit, Reem; Aljawaldeh, Ayoub; Van Royen, Kathleen; Pabian, Sara; Decorte, Paulien; Cuykx, Isabelle; Teunissen, Lauranna; De Backer, Charlotte; Palomares Estrada, Lita","Resumen:Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed the fragility of the global food system, sending shockwaves across countries' societies and economy. This has presented formidable challenges to sustaining a healthy and resilient lifestyle. The objective of this study is to examine the food consumption patterns and assess diet diversity indicators, primarily focusing on the food consumption score (FCS), among households in 38 countries both before and during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A cross-sectional study with 37 207 participants (mean age: 36.70 ± 14.79, with 77 % women) was conducted in 38 countries through an online survey administered between April and June 2020. The study utilized a pre-tested food frequency questionnaire to explore food consumption patterns both before and during the COVID-19 periods. Additionally, the study computed Food Consumption Score (FCS) as a proxy indicator for assessing the dietary diversity of households. Findings: This quantification of global, regional and national dietary diversity across 38 countries showed an increment in the consumption of all food groups but a drop in the intake of vegetables and in the dietary diversity. The household's food consumption scores indicating dietary diversity varied across regions. It decreased in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) countries, including Lebanon (p < 0.001) and increased in the Gulf Cooperation Council countries including Bahrain (p = 0.003), Egypt (p < 0.001) and United Arab Emirates (p = 0.013). A decline in the household's dietary diversity was observed in Australia (p < 0.001), in South Africa including Uganda (p < 0.001), in Europe including Belgium (p < 0.001), Denmark (p = 0.002), Finland (p < 0.001) and Netherland (p = 0.027) and in South America including Ecuador (p < 0.001), Brazil (p < 0.001), Mexico (p < 0.0001) and Peru (p < 0.001). Middle and older ages [OR = 1.2; 95 % CI = [1.125–1.426] [OR = 2.5; 95 % CI = [1.951–3.064], being a woman [OR = 1.2; 95 % CI = [1.117–1.367], having a high education (p < 0.001), and showing amelioration in food-related behaviors [OR = 1.4; 95 % CI = [1.292–1.709] were all linked to having a higher dietary diversity. Conclusion: The minor to moderate changes in food consumption patterns observed across the 38 countries within relatively short time frames could become lasting, leading to a significant and prolonged reduction in dietary diversity, as demonstrated by our findings.",Elsevier,2023,https://repositorio.upch.edu.pe/handle/20.500.12866/14703
Challenges and Insights in Aggregatibacter aphrophilus endocarditis: a review of literature.,"Zacarías Mendoza, Nathalie Victoria; Gamarra Valverde, Norma Nicole; Robles Velarde, Víctor Justo","Resumen:Infective endocarditis is a serious disease associated with high mortality despite recent advances in diagnosis and treatment. Aggregatibacter aphrophilus  is a fastidious Gram-negative member of the HACEK organisms (Haemophilus spp.,  Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Cardiobacterium hominis, Eikenella  corrodens, and Kingella kingae). A. aphrophilus is associated with dental  infections but has also been implicated in cases of infective endocarditis. We  highlight the importance of a high index of suspicion in symptomatic patients  with an initial negative blood culture, particularly in high-risk groups such as  patients with congenital valve disease and prosthetic valve.

Comparison of Three Methods for Diagnosing Trichomoniasis in Female Patients with Sexual Activity Attended at a Hospital in Peru.,"Rosales-Rimache, Jaime; Inolopú Cucche, Jorge Luis; Soncco-Llulluy, Fernando C.; Medina-Ciprian, Leslie","Resumen:BACKGROUND: Trichomoniasis is a sexually transmitted infection that mainly affects women. The diagnosis is made by different methods that identify the  presence of Trichomonas vaginalis; therefore, sensitivity, specificity, and  performance are essential to guarantee an adequate diagnosis. Our study is aimed  at comparing three methods for diagnosing trichomoniasis in patients treated at a  hospital in Peru during the year 2018. METHODS: We designed a cross-sectional  study and enrolled women whose vaginal secretion samples were evaluated by direct  examination, Papanicolaou staining, and culture in the Diamond medium. RESULTS:  We evaluated 134 women with a mean age of 36.6 ± 12.1 years and a beginning of  sexual activity of 18.5 ± 3.0 years. We found leukocyte infiltration, fetid odor,  and strawberry cervix in 66.4%, 35.1%, and 18.7%. The prevalence of  trichomoniasis by the culture method, direct examination, and Papanicolaou was  32.1, 21.6, and 11.2%. The direct examination's sensitivity, specificity, and  diagnostic performance (AUC) were 65.1%, 98.9%, and 82.0%, while for the Pap  smear, they were 32.6%, 98.9%, and 65.7%%. CONCLUSION: The culture of T.  vaginalis is the gold standard for diagnosing trichomoniasis; however, direct  examination is a fast, specific alternative with good diagnostic performance. The  Pap test has low sensitivity and should not be used in settings where the  prevalence and risk factors for trichomoniasis are high.",Hindawi,2023,https://repositorio.upch.edu.pe/handle/20.500.12866/14707
Clipping of Bilateral Ophthalmic Artery Aneurysms Through a Single Craniotomy.,"Bocanegra Becerra, Jhon Ernesto; Koester, Stefan W.; Batista, Sávio; Perret, Caio M.; Bertani, Raphael","Resumen:Bilateral ophthalmic aneurysms are rare and involve two aneurysms in the ophthalmic arteries, one on each, leading to potential symptoms such as vision  loss and headaches. The treatment options for aneurysms, ranging from surgery and  endovascular embolization to observation, depend on various factors, including  aneurysm size and the patient's health. Microsurgery, while presenting  complexities due to the intricate anatomy of the anterior clinoid region, offers  potential advantages such as enhanced decompression rates and reduced aneurysm  recurrence. The presented surgical video illustrates the treatment of bilateral  ophthalmic artery aneurysms via a single craniotomy. This method reduces surgical  duration and trauma, facilitating quicker patient recovery. However, this method  bears potential risks, especially to both optic nerves. As underscored in the  video, the utmost anatomical understanding in the anterior clinoid area is  pivotal for successful outcomes and reduced complications.",Springer,2023,https://repositorio.upch.edu.pe/handle/20.500.12866/14706

All participants provided demographic and clinical  history and received clinical evaluations. Diagnostics, including neuroimaging, cysticercosis serologies, and EEG, were obtained where possible. The data presented are from the cross-sectional baseline assessment of cohort  participants. Results: Approximately 38% of participants met the criteria for  NCC. Those with NCC were more likely to have adult-onset epilepsy, as well as a  longer duration of epilepsy, as compared to their counterparts without NCC. Overall, the data indicate a large treatment gap, with only approximately a  quarter of the baseline population with prescriptions for anti-seizure  medications. Conclusions: These data reveal a high proportion of NCC among  people living with epilepsy in these communities, with limited health care  resources. At baseline, 74% of the population were not receiving anti-seizure treatments. Further analyses of these data will clarify the natural history of  the disease for this population.",MDPI,2023,https://repositorio.upch.edu.pe/handle/20.500.12866/14705
The Prevalence and Etiologies of Transverse Myelitis in Latin America: A Systematic Review,"Almubaslat, F; Underwood, M; Torian, S; Salvatierra Vega, Justina Luz; Aponte Castro, Rocío del Pilar; Baldwin-SoRelle, C; Carlson, R; Diaz, M","Resumen:Objective: To investigate the prevalence of transverse myelitis (TM) in Latin America (LA) and identify common etiologies and preferred diagnostic tools. Background: TM is a rare neuroinflammatory condition of the spinal cord that can cause chronic and debilitating symptoms. TM is understudied in developing regions of the world, including in LA, leading to inequities in access to care. There is a need to investigate the disease’s prevalence in LA. Design/Methods: We searched PubMed and Cochrane Library for articles published in English, Spanish or Portuguese from 2010 to 2022 related to TM in LA. After excluding articles that did not meet eligibility criteria, we extracted data on population characteristics, TM frequency, etiologies, and diagnostics from each included article for descriptive analysis. Results: No studies were found that examined TM prevalence in LA or within a specific LA country. A total of 42 studies were included that investigated TM among LA populations with various primary diseases and 1 study on TM among a community population. A wide range of TM frequency data was found spanning 20 different LA countries. Demyelinating disease was the most commonly investigated TM etiology (n=25 studies) with the highest prevalence rates of TM. Infectious (n=15), idiopathic (n=3), vascular (n=1), and post-vaccinal (n=1) etiologies were also examined in included studies. The most frequently utilized diagnostic tools for identifying TM were MRI, CSF cytology and CSF or serum antibodies specific to demyelinating or infectious diseases. Conclusions: This review highlights important gaps in identifying TM among general community populations and diseased subpopulations of non-demyelinating etiologies in LA. There may also be diagnostic access barriers to identifying TM outside of tertiary referral centers and specialized outpatient clinics. By improving our understanding of TM epidemiology in LA and diagnostic barriers, we may improve disability and health outcomes for patients with TM in LA.

Generación de un test predictivo para el diagnóstico de la etiología de la hemorragia digestiva alta variceal,"Pérez Condori, Luis Yasser; Alvarado-Malca, Arnold Esthif; Loza Munarriz, Cesar Antonio; Espinoza Ríos, Jorge Luis","Resumen:Our objective was to develop a diagnostic test to predict the etiology of Variceal Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding (VUGIB). We conducted a retrospective cohort study. Medical records of patients over 18 years of age with Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding (UGIB) who attended the emergency service of Hospital Cayetano Heredia (HCH) in Lima-Peru between 2019 and 2022 were reviewed; demographic, laboratory and clinical data were collected. Subsequently, predictive variables of variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding (VUGIB) were identified using multiple logistic regression. Each variable with predictive capacity was assigned a score with a cut-off point and served to build a predictive scale for VUGIB. 197 medical records of patients with UGIB were included, of which 127 (64%) had non-variceal bleeding, and 70 (36%), variceal. Four independent predictors were identified: hematemesis (red vomit) (OR: 4,192, 95% CI: 1.586-11.082), platelet count (OR: 3.786, 95% CI: 1.324-10.826), history of UGIB (OR: 2.634, 95% CI: 1.017-6.820), signs of chronic liver disease (OR: 11.244, 95% CI: 3.067-35.047), with which a predictive scale was constructed, with a cut-off point >7 and ≤7; which showed a sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, positive likelihood ratio, and negative of 58.6%, 90.6%, 77.4%, 79.9%, 6.20, and 0.46 respectively.

Unveiling the Burden of Miscoding and Misclassification in Stroke Mortality: Analysis of Multiple Cause-of-Death Data in Mexico.,"Cahuana Hurtado, Lucero; Gómez-Dantés, Héctor; De la Cruz-Góngora, Vanessa; Chiquete, Erwin; Cantú-Brito, Carlos","Resumen:BACKGROUND: The prevalence of risk factors for cerebrovascular diseases in Mexico is increasing although stroke mortality declined from 1990 to 2010, without  meaningful changes afterward. While improving access to adequate prevention and  care could explain this trend, miscoding and misclassification in death  certificates need to be assessed to unveil the true burden of stroke in Mexico.  Practices in death certification along with the presence of multi-morbidity could  contribute to this distortion. Analyses of multiple causes of death could reveal  ill-defined stroke deaths, providing a glimpse of this bias. METHODS:  Cause-of-death information from 4,262,666 death certificates in Mexico from 2009  to 2015, was examined to determine the extent of miscoding and misclassification  on the true burden of stroke. Age-standardized mortality rates per 100,000  inhabitants (ASMR) were calculated for stroke as underlying and multiple causes  of death, by sex and state. Deaths were classified following international  standards as ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage,  and unspecified, which were kept as an independent category to measure miscoding.  To approximate misclassification, we compared ASMR under three misclassification  scenarios: (1) current (the status quo); (2) moderate, which includes deaths from  selected causes mentioning stroke; and (3) high which includes all deaths  mentioning stroke. National and subnational data were analyzed to search for  geographical patterns. RESULTS: The burden of stroke in Mexico is underreported  due to miscoding and misclassification. Miscoding is an important issue since  almost 60% of all stroke deaths are registered as unspecified. Multiple cause  analysis indicates that stroke ASMR could increase 39.9%-52.9% of the current  ASMR under moderate and high misclassification scenarios, respectively. Both  problems indicate the need to improve death codification procedures and  cause-of-death classification. CONCLUSIONS: Miscoding and misclassification lead  to underestimation of the burden of stroke in Mexico. Stroke deaths are  underreported when other important causes coexist, being diabetes the most  frequent.",Karger,2023,https://repositorio.upch.edu.pe/handle/20.500.12866/14681
The role of flow in the self-assembly of dragline spider silk proteins,"Herrera-Rodríguez, Ana M.; Dasanna, Anil Kumar; Daday, Csaba; Cruz Chú, Eduardo Roberto; Aponte-Santamaría, Camilo; Schwarz, Ulrich S.; Gräter, Frauke","Resumen:Hydrodynamic flow in the spider duct induces conformational changes in dragline spider silk proteins (spidroins) and drives their assembly, but the underlying physical mechanisms are still elusive. Here we address this challenging multiscale problem with a complementary strategy of atomistic and coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations with uniform flow. The conformational changes at the molecular level were analyzed for single-tethered spider silk peptides. Uniform flow leads to coiled-to-stretch transitions and pushes alanine residues into β sheet and poly-proline II conformations. Coarse-grained simulations of the assembly process of multiple semi-flexible block copolymers using multi-particle collision dynamics reveal that the spidroins aggregate faster but into low-order assemblies when they are less extended. At medium-to-large peptide extensions (50%–80%), assembly slows down and becomes reversible with frequent association and dissociation events, whereas spidroin alignment increases and alanine repeats form ordered regions. Our work highlights the role of flow in guiding silk self-assembly into tough fibers by enhancing alignment and kinetic reversibility, a mechanism likely relevant also for other proteins whose function depends on hydrodynamic flow.",Elsevier,2023,https://repositorio.upch.edu.pe/handle/20.500.12866/14679

A cross-sectional study was conducted among PLWH  at the largest HIV-referral center in Lima, Peru, to describe TB knowledge among  PLWH and potential associated sociodemographic factors. Participants answered a  self-administered survey on TB knowledge, which consisted of five questions about  TB cure, transmission, treatment, symptoms, and prevention. Of 179 PLWH enrolled,  most participants did not know that isoniazid (85%) and antiretrovirals (78%) are  preventive measures for TB, and 56 (31.3%) knew that TB can be asymptomatic in  PLWH. We did not find statistical differences in TB knowledge based on gender,  education, marital status, and time on HIV care. We identified important gaps in  TB knowledge among PLWH.

Visceral larva Migrans in a Young Italian Patient: A Diagnostic Dilemma,"Francalanci, E.; Manciulli, T.; Bandini, G.; Blanc, P.; Bonelli, S.I.; Brunetti, E.; Gotuzzo Herencia, José Eduardo; Cretu, C.M.; Gobbi, F.; Bartoloni, A.; Zammarchi, L.","Resumen:Background: The association of fever, focal hepatic lesions and peripheral hyper-eosinophilia (FHLH) can be observed in both infectious and non-infectious conditions. Fascioliasis, capillariasis, toxocariasis, all causes of visceral larva migrans (VLM), represent most of the former, whilst lymphomas, eosinophilic leukemias and mastocytosis belong in the non-infectious conditions. Methods: We prospectively followed a young patient presenting with FHLH in the Tuscany region of Italy. Results: The patient was subject to serological and parasitological examination in an attempt to clarify the origin of the lesions. Serologies for both Fasciola hepatica and Toxocara spp. were positive, with the latter presenting a higher index. We opted for treatment with a prolonged course of albendazole due to the serological results and being toxocariasis more frequent in our setting. The patient was then subject to radiological follow-up. The patient responded to treatment with albendazole as shown by a decrease in eosinophils, seronegativization for Toxocara spp., clinical and radiological improvement. Toxocariasis was hence considered the most likely diagnosis. Conclusions: Parasitic infections cannot be disregarded in the presence of FHLH. Differential diagnosis between these parasitic infections can be challenging due to the presence of similar clinical presentations and serological cross-reactions, and follow-up of the patient is needed to ensure optimal treatment outcomes.",Springer,2023,https://repositorio.upch.edu.pe/handle/20.500.12866/14682

Restoration of a Vital Tooth With Extensive Crown Destruction Using Glass Fiber and Polyethylene Fiber-reinforced Composite Resin: A Clinical Case,"Saravia Rojas, Miguel Ángel; Espinoza Jimenez, Giulianna Alessandra; Huanambal Tiravanti, Víctor Abel; Geng-Vivanco, R.","Resumen:Conservative restorative dentistry has been evolving in the last 25 years, focusing mainly on the development of direct restorative materials. Resin-based composites remain an excellent conservative alternative for restoration of teeth with extensive caries lesions. Over time, several strategies have been proposed to improve the mechanical properties of these composites so that they can adequately withstand masticatory forces. Glass fiber-reinforced resin-based composites and their use in situations where there is great loss of tooth structure have gained popularity due to their favorable mechanical properties. Combined techniques with polyethylene fibers can further enhance their clinical performance. This study presents a brief review of their most important qualities and potential use in direct restorative procedures. In addition, a clinical case is described where a vital tooth with extensive coronal destruction was restored using polyethylene fibers embedded in glass fiber-reinforced flowable resin under resin-based composite. The reinforcement of both the remaining tooth structure and the restoration with fibers is a valid treatment option since the network structure formed by the fiber reinforcement can increase the longevity of the direct composite restorations. There are few reports in the literature describing the use of a combined technique using polyethylene fibers embedded in glass fiber-reinforced flowable resin under resin-based composite. Thus, clinical follow-up of this case is required.",Indiana University School of Dentistry,2023,https://repositorio.upch.edu.pe/handle/20.500.12866/14665

METHODS: This was a pilot  single-blinded, three-armed phase II randomized clinical trial, controlled with  EPT. Sixty participants were randomly assigned to receive treatment for 3 months:  (1) an oral herbal supplement of 1,500 mg/d (G1, n = 20), (2) an oral herbal  supplement of 3,000 mg/d (G2, n = 20), or (3) conjugated equine estrogens 0.625  mg/d plus medroxyprogesterone acetate of 5 mg/d (EPT group, n = 20). The primary  endpoint was the intensity of menopausal symptoms as measured using the  Menopause-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire (global and domain scores). The  Menopause-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire uses a 7-point scale to rate the  symptom intensity, with higher scores indicating severity. The secondary  endpoints were hormonal, lipid, and safety profiles. RESULTS: Fifty-four  participants (n = 54) completed the study. The mean, model-estimated, and global  menopausal symptom scores at 3 months were 85.8 in the EPT group, 61.3 in G1, and  62.5 in G2. Participants treated with the herbal compound had lower global (13.7  [6.9-20.4], P < 0.001) and physical symptom scores (6.6 [1.6-11.5], P = 0.002) on  the second month and lower psychosocial symptom scores (3.8 [1.3 to 6.3], P <  0.001) on the third month of follow-up, compared with EPT. Conversely,  participants receiving EPT showed better outcomes on vasomotor symptoms since the  first month of treatment (-6.1 [-8.3 to -4.0], P < 0.001). The EPT group  exhibited higher values of estradiol and lower follicle-stimulating hormone and  luteinizing hormone since the first month of follow-up. Also, total cholesterol,  low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol  were significantly higher in this group than in G2. CONCLUSIONS: In this small  single-blind exploratory trial, the oral herbal supplement was more efficacious  in reducing global, physical, and psychosocial menopausal symptoms in the short  term than EPT. However, further studies are needed to adequately assess the  efficacy and safety of this herbal supplement in the treatment of menopausal  symptoms.",Wolters Kluwer Health,2023,https://repositorio.upch.edu.pe/handle/20.500.12866/14671

Additionally,  medical societies play an important role. The Latin American Group of Experts on  Infant Immunization, established in 2018, advises on the harmonization, update,  and optimization of infant vaccination programs in Latin America and the  Caribbean (LAC). In September 2021, 41 such experts from 13 LAC countries met to  develop recommendations for increasing regional vaccination coverage to avoid the  reemergence of vaccine-preventable diseases and/or the occurrence of outbreaks.  AREAS COVERED: The following items were evaluated: (i) immunization challenges  before and during the COVID-19 pandemic; (ii) the status of current immunization  programs, particularly infant pertussis and polio vaccination; (iii) possible  solutions for overcoming vaccination challenges and achieving regional  vaccination coverage targets. EXPERT OPINION/COMMENTARY: Medical societies  provide valuable recommendations to guide and update vaccination schedules.

Srinath; Settle, Dykki; Tritter, Beth; Benn, Christoph","Resumen:Global campaigns to control HIV, tuberculosis, malaria, and vaccine-preventable illnesses showed that large-scale impact can be achieved by using additional  international financing to support selected, evidence-based, high-impact  investment areas and to catalyse domestic resource mobilisation. Building on this  paradigm, we make the case for targeting additional international funding for  selected high-impact investments in primary health care. We have identified and  costed a set of concrete, evidence-based investments that donors could support,  which would be expected to have major impacts at an affordable cost. These  investments are in: (1) individuals and communities empowered to engage in health  decision making, (2) a new model of people-centred primary care, and (3) next  generation community health workers. These three areas would be supported by  strengthening two cross-cutting elements of national systems. The first is the  digital tools and data that support facility, district, and national managers to  improve processes, quality of care, and accountability across primary health  care. The second is the educational, training, and supervisory systems needed to  improve the quality of care. We estimate that with an additional international  investment of between US$1·87 billion in a low-investment scenario and $3·85  billion in a high-investment scenario annually over the next 3 years, the  international community could support the scale-up of this evidence-based package  of investments in the 59 low-income and middle-income countries that are eligible  for external financing from the World Bank Group's International Development  Association.",Elsevier,2023,https://repositorio.upch.edu.pe/handle/20.500.12866/14666
Risk factors associated with saphenous vein graft aneurysm after coronary artery bypass graft.,"Ghosh, Bikona; SIbi Krishna, Thiyagarajan; Boini, Aishwarya; Del Castillo Miranda, José Carlos; Sinha, Mehul; Bansal, Radha; Visconti-Lopez, Fabriccio J.; Mesfin Girma, Samuel; Aliye Asfaw, Yonathan","Resumen:INTRODUCTION: Saphenous vein graft aneurysm (SVGA) is a rare but life-threatening complication following coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). The authors aim to  identify the potential risk factors that lead to SVGA in post-CABG patients.  METHODS: A systematic review of original studies, observational studies,  systematic reviews, meta-analyses, case studies, and case series was conducted  using PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, EMBASE, and Google Scholar involving adult  patients (>18) with SVGA after CABG using MESH terminology in a broad search  strategy. All searches were performed and analyzed according to PRISMA and  duplicates were removed via Rayyan. Two independent investigators extracted and  assessed the data involving demographics, and baseline data related to CABG and  its manifestations. RESULTS: Out of 487 finalized articles, 14 of them matched  the inclusion requirements and reported 12 cases of SVGAs following CABG.  Atherosclerosis with intimal calcification was the most common risk factor  followed by infection. Others included hyperlipidemia, pneumonia, and cardiac  pathologies mostly related to the ventricles and valves. CONCLUSION:  Atherosclerosis associated with intimal calcification is the most common risk  factor. Patient outcomes seem to improve upon early identification and regular  follow-up imaging. The exclusion criteria indicated the study's limits, and  future studies that address these constraints may be able to better understand  the risk variables involved in the genesis of SVGA.",Elsevier,2023,https://repositorio.upch.edu.pe/handle/20.500.12866/14667

Jaime; Mamas, Mamas A.; Zühlke, Liesl J.; Kontopantelis, Evan; Thabane, Lehana; Van Spall, Harriette G. C.","Resumen:BACKGROUND: Heart failure (HF) is a global epidemic. OBJECTIVE: To assess global sex differences in HF epidemiology across country income levels. METHODS AND  RESULTS: Using Global Burden of Disease (GBD) data from 204 countries and  territories 1990-2019, we assessed sex differences in HF prevalence, etiology,  morbidity, and temporal trends across country sociodemographic index or gross  national income. We derived age-standardized rates. Of 56.2 million (95%  uncertainty interval [UI] 46.4-67.8 million) people with HF in 2019, 50.3% were  females and 69.2% lived in low- and middle-income countries; age-standardized  prevalence was greater in males and in high-income countries. Ischaemic and  hypertensive heart disease were top causes of HF in males and females,  respectively. There were 5.1 million (95% UI 3.3-7.3 million) years lived with  disability, distributed equally between sexes. Between 1990 and 2019, there was  an increase in HF cases, but a decrease in age-standardized rates per 100 000 in  males (9.1%, from 864.2 to 785.7) and females (5.8%, from 686.0 to 646.1).  High-income regions experienced a 16.0% decrease in age-standardized rates (from  877.5 to 736.8), while low-income regions experienced a 3.9% increase (from 612.1  to 636.0), largely consistent across sexes. There was a temporal increase in  age-standardized HF from hypertensive, rheumatic, and calcific aortic valvular  heart disease, and a decrease from ischaemic heart disease, with regional and sex  differences. CONCLUSION: Age-standardized HF rates have decreased over time, with  larger decreases in males than females; and with large decreases in high-income  and small increases in low-income regions.

These effects interact with existing social vulnerabilities, exacerbating their impact on the health and wellbeing of populations. This viewpoint highlights four main messages from the series, which presented key gaps from five different perspectives of health and climate. First, there is an overall need for local analyses of priority topics to inform public policy, which include national and sub-national evidence to adequately strengthen responses and preparedness for climate change hazards and address relevant social vulnerabilities in South American countries. Second, research in health and climate is done in silos and the intersection is not clear in terms of responsibility and leadership; therefore, transdisciplinary research and action are key. Third, climate research, policies, and action need to be reflected in effective funding schemes, which until now are very limited. For adaptation and mitigation policies to be effective, they need a robust and long-term funding scheme. Finally, climate action is a big opportunity for healthier and more prosperous societies in South America, taking the advantage of strategic climate policies to face the challenges of climate change and tackle existing social inequities.",Elsevier,2023,https://repositorio.upch.edu.pe/handle/20.500.12866/14677

Particulate matter (PM),  particularly PM2.5 and ultrafine particles (UFP), is a key contributor to the  adverse effects of air pollution on cardiovascular health. PM exposure can lead  to oxidative stress, inflammation, atherosclerosis, vascular dysfunction, cardiac  arrhythmias, and myocardial injury. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a key role  in mediating these effects. PM exposure can also lead to hypertension, a  significant risk factor for cardiovascular disease. The COVID-19 pandemic  resulted in a significant reduction of air pollutants, leading to a decline in  the incidence of heart attacks and premature deaths caused by cardiovascular  diseases. This review highlights the relationship between environmental air  quality and cardiovascular health, elucidating the pathways through which air  pollutants affect the cardiovascular system. It also emphasizes the need for  increased awareness, collective efforts to mitigate the adverse effects of air  pollution, and strategic policies for long-term air quality improvement to  prevent the devastating effects of air pollution on global cardiovascular health.",Elsevier,2023,https://repositorio.upch.edu.pe/handle/20.500.12866/14676

Even though the phenomenon of immunoreactivity reversion is neither new nor rare, its implications for the estimation of the ARI have been largely dismissed. Given how the ARI is calculated, the observed changes in immunoreactivity lead to concrete discrepancies in the metric when accounting for reversion. Our work explored how ARI estimation is affected when accounting for varying reversion probabilities ranging from 0% per year to 50% per year, covering a wide range of scenarios.

The main objective of this study was to evaluate the invariance of the cross-cultural measurement of the SAS10 in a sample of 12 Latin American countries. Additionally, the difficulty and discrimination characteristics of the items were evaluated using the IRT and social anomie was compared between the participating countries. A total of 4,911 people from 12 Latin American countries (Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Cuba, Ecuador, Guatemala, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela) selected by non-probabilistic snowball sampling participated. The results indicated that the original two-factor model of the SAS10 shows estimation problems and low fit indices in several countries. However, a model of two related dimensions (behavioral and affective) of nine items (SAS-9) presented adequate fit indices in all countries. This model presents adequate estimation of reliability and approximate cross-cultural measurement invariance. Peru was the country with the highest score in the behavioral dimension of social anomie; while Venezuela and Bolivia presented the highest scores in the affective dimension. Mexico was one of the countries with the lowest anomie scores. The results of the IRT would indicate that the characteristics of the SAS-9 items were appropriate. It is concluded that the SAS-9 has shown good psychometric properties when evaluated in 12 Latin American countries and can be used in future studies that compare social anomie cross-culturally.","South-West University ""Neofit Rilski""",2023,https://repositorio.upch.edu.pe/handle/20.500.12866/14673
Spatial transferability of an agent-based model to simulate Taenia solium control interventions,"Pizzitutti, Francesco; Bonnet, Gabrielle; Gonzales-Gustavson, Eloy; Gabriël, Sarah; Pan, William K.; Gonzalez, Armando E.; García Lescano, Héctor Hugo; O'Neal, Seth E.","Resumen:Background: Models can be used to study and predict the impact of interventions aimed at controlling the spread of infectious agents, such as Taenia solium, a zoonotic parasite whose larval stage causes epilepsy and economic loss in many rural areas of the developing nations. To enhance the credibility of model estimates, calibration against observed data is necessary. However, this process may lead to a paradoxical dependence of model parameters on location-specific data, thus limiting the model’s geographic transferability. Methods: In this study, we adopted a non-local model calibration approach to assess whether it can improve the spatial transferability of CystiAgent, our agent-based model of local-scale T. solium transmission. The calibration dataset for CystiAgent consisted of cross-sectional data on human taeniasis, pig cysticercosis and pig serology collected in eight villages in Northwest Peru. After calibration, the model was transferred to a second group of 21 destination villages in the same area without recalibrating its parameters. Model outputs were compared to pig serology data collected over a period of 2 years in the destination villages during a trial of T. solium control interventions, based on mass and spatially targeted human and pig treatments. Results: Considering the uncertainties associated with empirical data, the model produced simulated pre-intervention pig seroprevalences that were successfully validated against data collected in 81% of destination villages. Furthermore, the model outputs were able to reproduce validated pig seroincidence values in 76% of destination villages when compared to the data obtained after the interventions. The results demonstrate that the CystiAgent model, when calibrated using a non-local approach, can be successfully transferred without requiring additional calibration. Conclusions: This feature allows the model to simulate both baseline pre-intervention transmission conditions and the outcomes of control interventions across villages that form geographically homogeneous regions, providing a basis for developing large-scale models representing T. solium transmission at a regional level.",BioMed Central,2023,https://repositorio.upch.edu.pe/handle/20.500.12866/14672
Testing the effectiveness of household fuel conservation strategies: Policy implications for increasing the affordability of exclusive clean cooking,"Williams, Kendra N.; Kamenar, Katarina; Kephart, Josiah L.; Chiang, Marilu; Hartinger Peña, Stella Maria; Checkley, William","Resumen:Background: Exclusive clean fuel use is essential for realizing health and other benefits but is often unaffordable. Decreasing household-level fuel needs could make exclusive clean fuel use more affordable, but there is a lack of knowledge on the amount of fuel savings that could be achieved through fuel conservation behaviors relevant to rural settings in low- and middle-income countries. Methods: Within a trial in Peru, we trained a random half of intervention participants, who had previously received a liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) stove and were purchasing their own fuel, on fuel conservation strategies. We measured the amount of fuel and mega joules (MJ) of energy consumed by all participants, including control participants who were receiving free fuel from the trial. We administered surveys on fuel conservation behaviors and assigned a score based on the number of behaviors performed. Results: Intervention participants with the training had a slightly higher conservation score than those without (7.2 vs. 6.6 points; p = 0.07). Across all participants, average daily energy consumption decreased by 9.5 MJ for each 1-point increase in conservation score (p < 0.001). Among households who used exclusively LPG (n = 99), each 1-point increase in conservation score was associated with a 0.04 kg decrease in LPG consumption per household per day (p = 0.03). Using pressure cookers and heating water in the sun decreased energy use, while using clay pots and forgetting to close stove knobs increased energy use. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that a household could save 1.16 kg of LPG per month for each additional fuel conservation behavior, for a maximum potential savings of 8.1 kg per month. Fuel conservation messaging could be integrated into national household energy policies to increase the affordability of exclusive clean fuel use, and subsequently achieve the environmental and health benefits that could accompany such a transition.",Elsevier,2023,https://repositorio.upch.edu.pe/handle/20.500.12866/14674
Neurocognitive Impairment for Persons Living with HIV in Peru: A National Physician Survey,"Slotkin, R; Huff, H; Granda Calderón, Camila Lucero; Cabera, D; Diaz, M; Villafane, CMB; Hsieh, E; Garcia Funegra, Patricia Jannet","Resumen:Objective: To describe HIV provider screening and management practices for neurocognitive impairment (NCI) in persons living with HIV (PLWH) in Peru. Background: As PLWH on antiretrovirals achieve longer lifespans, they experience an increased risk of non-communicable diseases, in particular NCI. In Peru, 28.5% of PLWH > 40 years old were found to have NCI (Diaz 2021). However, there is no data on Peruvian HIV provider management of NCI. Design/Methods: Public sector physicians affiliated with Peru’s National HIV, STI and Hepatitis Program were identified by the Program’s provider registry and through regional Program coordinator referral. Willing participants completed a telephone survey, which included: (1) socio-demographics (2) comfort level addressing NCI prevention, diagnosis, and treatment (4-point Likert scale: no certainty, little certainty, certain, very certain), (3) NCI screening frequency, and (4) NCI practice patterns (free response). Results: Seventy-eight of 167 identified physicians completed the survey (mean age 45.8±9.3; 26% women; 61% from coastal regions, 18% highlands, 21% jungle; 78% infectious disease specialists). The majority reported lack of comfort (‘no certainty’ or ‘little certainty’) with NCI prevention (59%), diagnosis (53%), and treatment (76%). Comfort level was not associated with any provider sociodemographic characteristics. Sixty-seven percent (52/78) attempted NCI management, 31% (24/78) solely referred to a specialist, and 3% (2/78) did not manage NCI. Management strategies described included: evaluating for contributing opportunistic infections, substance use, or medications (36%), ordering neuroimaging (18%), re-evaluating antiretroviral regimen (17%), performing cognitive assessments (17%), and ruling-out depression (6%). Of physicians who reported at least one of these management strategies, 98% also referred to neurology, psychology, neuropsychology, or geriatrics. Conclusions: Although the majority of physicians reported lack of comfort managing NCI in PLWH, most still engaged in some form of NCI management. There is a need to develop training programs, screening tools, and guidelines to standardize the approach to NCI in PLWH in Peru.

According to the American College of  Rheumatology (ACR), 19 neuropsychiatric syndromes types of SLE are classified  into categories encompassing the central and peripheral nervous systems. This  study aimed to investigate the frequency of neuropsychiatric manifestations in  systemic lupus erythematosus patients admitted to Hospital Cayetano Heredia in  Lima, Peru, between 2008 and 2019. METHODS: A retrospective observational study  was conducted, entailing the review of 240 medical records of patients diagnosed  with systemic lupus erythematosus during the specified period, based on the  Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics (SLICC) 2012 criteria. Among  these records, 55 patients presented neuropsychiatric systemic lupus  erythematosus (NPSLE). Data were collected using standardized form and entered  into Microsoft Excel 2019 database. Statistical analysis was performed using  Stata v16. RESULTS: The frequency of neuropsychiatric compromise in systemic  lupus erythematosus patients was found to be 22.91%. Among the 55 systemic lupus  erythematosus patients, 40 demonstrated involvement of the central nervous system  (72.72%), 2 exhibited involvement of the peripheral nervous system (3.63%), and  13 displayed involvement in both the central nervous system and peripheral  nervous system (23.63%).

A major impediment to establish high-throughput in vitro P. vivax liver stage assays for drug development is obtaining sufficient numbers of sporozoites. To do so, female anopheline mosquitoes have to be fed on blood from P. vivax-infected patients through an artificial membrane-feeding system, which in turns requires a well-established Anopheles colony. In this study we established conditions to provide a robust supply of P. vivax sporozoites. Adding a combination of serum replacement and antibiotics to the membrane-feeding protocol was found to best improve sporozoite production. A simple centrifugation method appears to be a possible tool for rapidly obtaining purified sporozoites with a minimal loss of yield. However, this method needs to be better defined since sporozoite viability and hepatocyte infection were not evaluated.",Nature Research,2023,https://repositorio.upch.edu.pe/handle/20.500.12866/14658

Oral lactoferrin administration does not impact the diversity or composition of the infant gut microbiota in a Peruvian cohort.,"Gonzalez Villaseca, Luis Antonio; Paredes Sosa, José Luis; Mosquito Guillen, Susan Grace; Filio Azañedo, Yesenia; Romero, Pedro E.; Ochoa Woodell, Theresa Jean; Tsukayama Cisneros, Pablo","Resumen:Lactoferrin is a protein from breast milk involved in early-life microbiome assembly. It is believed to promote the growth of lactic acid-producing bacteria  and inhibit pathogens by limiting iron availability and enabling an acidic  environment in the gut. Previous reports suggest that oral administration of  lactoferrin in neonates promotes the increase of gut microbiota diversity and the  enrichment of beneficial microbes. However, its effect on infant gut microbiota  over time has yet to be thoroughly studied to fully understand its potential as a  prebiotic. Using 16s rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, we analyzed the gut  microbiota composition of 60 toddlers at 12-18 months of age from Lima, Peru, who  received daily oral administration of lactoferrin or placebo for 6 months since  enrollment. Samples were analyzed at 0, 2, and 4 months after beginning  treatment. Our results show that lactoferrin treatment does not increase gut  microbiota diversity over time nor affect its bacterial composition compared to  the placebo group.IMPORTANCEPrevious studies have suggested that oral lactoferrin  enhances diversity in the gut microbiota in infants while inhibiting the growth  of opportunistic pathogens. However, the effect of lactoferrin on infant gut  microbiota over time has yet to be thoroughly studied. Our study suggests that  lactoferrin oral treatment in infants aged 12-18 months does not affect gut  microbiome diversity and composition over time.

Methods: A retrospective observational study was conducted in 17 Latin American centres. There were included cases of OSCC, analysing age, gender, OSCC and their association with previous OPMD. Clinicopathological variables were retrieved. The condition of sequential-OSCC versus OSCC-de novo (OSCC-dn) was analysed concerning the aforementioned variables. Quantitative variables were analysed using Student's t-test, and qualitative variables with chi-square. Results: In total, 2705 OSCC were included with a mean age of 62.8 years old. 55.8% were men. 53.75% of the patients were smokers and 38% were common drinkers. The lateral tongue border was the most affected site (24.65%). There were regional variations in OPMD, being leukoplakia the most frequent. Of the overall 2705 OSCC cases, 81.4% corresponded to OSCC-dn, while s-OSCC were 18.6%. Regarding lip vermillion SCC, 35.7% corresponded to de novo lip SCC and 64.3% were associated with previous OPMD. Conclusions: In Latin America, OSCC-dn seems to be more frequent with regional variations of some clinical and histopathological features. Further prospective studies are needed to analyse this phenomenon.",Wiley,2023,https://repositorio.upch.edu.pe/handle/20.500.12866/14660
Prioritising and planning scale-up research projects targeting non-communicable diseases: a mixed-method study by the Global Alliance for Chronic Diseases  upscaling working group.,"Ramani-Chander, Anusha; Thrift, Amanda; van Olmen, Josefien; Wouters, Edwin; Delobelle, Peter; Vedanthan, Rajesh; Miranda, J. Jaime; Sherwood, Stephen; Teede, Helena J.; Joshi, Rohina","Resumen:INTRODUCTION: Governments must scale-up evidence-based interventions to reduce the burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Implementation research can help  develop contextually appropriate strategies and optimise interventions for  scale-up. We aimed to determine the priorities of the Global Alliance for Chronic  Diseases (GACD) 2019 funding round for scale-up research targeting NCD  interventions. The research questions were: (a) What was the purpose of the call  and what were the specific issues considered by funders when supporting the  selected projects? (b) How did the selected research projects align with the  objectives of GACD scale-up call? METHODS: We undertook a mixed-methods study to  examine the projects funded by the GACD in 2019. We completed semistructured  interviews with representatives from 5 out of 8 funding agencies and complemented  this by reviewing project documents from 21 (78%) of the 27 funded studies. A  literature review of scale-up frameworks informed the interview guide and data  extraction template. The transcripts were open-coded using thematic analysis to  identify critical issues for funders. Data were extracted to identify the common  elements considered when planning, implementing and evaluating interventions for  scale-up. RESULTS: Interviews with the funders revealed three enabling themes  related to scale-up: local research priorities (contextualisation through  engagement), capacity building (developing knowledge base) and connections  (networking opportunities). We further identified that timelines (more  flexibility) and equity (funding low-income and middle-income researchers) could  be considered for future funding investments. Multidisciplinary international  research teams led the development of diverse studies to address funder's  priorities. The detailed plans included a range of implementation frameworks to  help develop contextual scale-up strategies. CONCLUSIONS: Fundamental to NCD  scale-up research are (1) funding opportunities that reflect the complexity and  time necessary to enable contextualisation; (2) investment in building  multidisciplinary research capacity and leadership and (3) better networking to  encourage cohesive action and align NCD-related scale-up research activities  globally.",BMJ Publishing Group,2023,https://repositorio.upch.edu.pe/handle/20.500.12866/14662
"Perceptions of Problems with Household Insects: Qualitative and Quantitative Findings from Peri-Urban Communities in Arequipa, Peru.","Castillo Neyra, Ricardo; Larson, Anika J.; Tamayo Quintero, Laura Daniela; Arevalo Nieto, Claudia Rebeca; Brown, Joanna; Condori Pino, Carlos Edgar; Ortega, Emma; Levy, Michael Zachary; Paz-Soldan Parlette, Valerie Andrea","Resumen:Vector-borne diseases continue to impose a major health burden on Peru and neighboring countries. The challenge of addressing vector-borne disease is  compounded by changing social, economic, and climatic conditions. Peri-urban  Arequipa is an important region to study insect infestations because of ongoing  challenges with disease vectors such as triatomines and a variety of other  insects. We conducted surveys (n = 1,182) and seven focus groups (average seven  participants) in peri-urban Arequipa to explore knowledge of and perception  toward various insects that infest the region. Focus group participants reported  the presence of a wide variety of insects in and around the home, including  disease vectors such as triatomines (also identified by 27.2% of survey  households), mosquitoes, spiders, and bed bugs, as well as nuisance insects.  Health concerns related to insects included vector-borne diseases, spider bites,  allergies, and sequelae from bed bug bites, and hygiene concerns. A majority of  participants in the quantitative surveys identified triatomines as the insect  they were most worried about (69.9%) and could identify Chagas disease as a  health risk associated with triatomines (54.9%). Insect infestations in  peri-urban Arequipa present multiple burdens to residents, including injury and  illness from triatomines and other insects, as well as potential mental and  economic concerns related to insects such as bed bugs. Future initiatives should  continue to address triatomine infestations through educational outreach and  implement a more holistic approach to address the burden of both disease and  nuisance insects.",American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene,2023,https://repositorio.upch.edu.pe/handle/20.500.12866/14661

However, IH is also increasingly used to enhance health and performance and is emerging as a potent non-pharmacological intervention against numerous diseases. Whether IH is detrimental or beneficial for health is largely determined by the intensity, duration, number and frequency of the hypoxic exposures and by the specific responses they engender. Adaptive responses to hypoxia protect from future hypoxic or ischaemic insults, improve cellular resilience and functions, and boost mental and physical performance. The cellular and systemic mechanisms producing these benefits are highly complex, and the failure of different components can shift long-term adaptation to maladaptation and the development of pathologies. Rather than discussing in detail the well-characterized individual responses and adaptations to IH, we here aim to summarize and integrate hypoxia-activated mechanisms into a holistic picture of the body's adaptive responses to hypoxia and specifically IH, and demonstrate how these mechanisms might be mobilized for their health benefits while minimizing the risks of hypoxia exposure.",Wiley,2023,https://repositorio.upch.edu.pe/handle/20.500.12866/14645

Microencapsulated essential oils influence the growth and foregut histomorphometry of Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) fingerlings,"Roldan-Juarez, Jesús; Pinares, Rubén; Smith, Carlos E.; Llerena Zavala, Cielo Aydeli; Machaca, Virgilio; Pizarro Paz, Dante Mauricio","Resumen:Essential oils supplementation has potential growth-promoting, antibacterial, and immunostimulatory effects for various fish species. Dietary supplementation with essential oils improves Nile tilapia's growth and intestinal morphology. The aim of the study was to assess the effect of supplementation with microencapsulated essential oils (MEOs) containing cinnamaldehyde (53.9 %), thymol (24.2 %), and carvacrol (18.7 %) in Nile tilapia fingerlings on growth parameters and foregut histomorphometry. Six thousand fishes with initial body weights and lengths of 1.20 ± 0.32 g and 2.03 ± 0.40 cm, respectively, were reared in two separate 60 m3 circular tanks (control and supplemented with 500 mg/kg of MEOs) at a 5 kg/m3 density. Growth parameters included weight and length. Ten foregut samples per tank were collected at 0-, 15- and 30-days post-treatment. The histological analysis involved the size of intestinal folds and the number of goblet cells. Our results showed that fingerling growth parameters such as final body weight and length increased by 16.9 % and 10.43 %, respectively, with MEOs supplementation compared to the control group. Furthermore, histomorphometry results showed that the supplementation of MEOs led to a significant increase in the growth of both the width and length of intestinal folds and the number of goblet cells (p &lt; 0.05). In conclusion, the early supplementation with MEOs improved the number, length, and width of intestinal folds and increased the number of goblet cells, positively influencing intestinal morphology and health. Additionally, MEOs improved growth parameters in Nile tilapia at 30 days of supplementation.",Elsevier,2023,https://repositorio.upch.edu.pe/handle/20.500.12866/14647

Microsurgical and endovascular treatment of posterior inferior cerebellar artery aneurysms: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Saal-Zapata, G.; Rodriguez-Calienes, A.; Malaga, M.; Velasquez-Rimachi, V.; Moran, C.; Bustamante-Paytan, D.; Pacheco Barrios, Niels Victor; Pacheco-Barrios, K.; Alva-Diaz, C.; Walker, M.","Resumen:INTRODUCTION: Posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) aneurysms are uncommon vascular lesions of the posterior fossa. In addition to aneurysmal morphology, structural anatomic considerations may confer additional procedural risk, and as a result there is currently no consensus as to whether a surgical or endovascular approach offers greater safety and efficacy for patients. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: We systematically examined peer-reviewed literature describing PICA aneurysm treatment planning from January 2000 to May 2021 using the PRISMA methodology. A meta-analysis of proportions was performed. Certainty of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Fifty-eight studies including 1673 PICA aneurysms were analyzed. Overall treatment occlusion rate was 97% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 93-100%) for surgery and 85% (95% CI: 78-92%) for endovascular therapy. The recurrence rate was 6% in the endovascular group and 1% for surgery. Overall morbidity and mortality were 16% and 7%, respectively. Intraoperative complications occurred in 9% of the surgical patients. CONCLUSIONS: Despite a large body of literature, analysis indicates that 62% of studies had moderate or serious risk of bias, suggesting very-low certainty results. Therefore, treatment via either approach should be determined on a case-by-case basis and according to institutional experience.",Edizioni Minerva Medica,2023,https://repositorio.upch.edu.pe/handle/20.500.12866/14648
Molecular Characterization of Genital and Extragenital Lesions With the PlexPCR VHS Assay in Patients Diagnosed With Syphilis.,"Eguiluz, Maria; Qquellon Palacios, Luz Jazmín; Vargas Rivera, Silver Keith; Reyes Díaz, Edward Michael; Konda, Kelika Anne; Caceres Palacios, Carlos Fernando; Klausner, Jeffrey D.","Resumen:BACKGROUND: Syphilis diagnosis relies on immunologic markers and clinical protocols. However, syphilitic lesions can be confused with other genital ulcer  diseases. METHODS: Using a PlexPCR VHS assay, we analyzed lesion DNA samples from  87 individuals who were clinically diagnosed with early syphilis infection and  had at least 1 positive serologic test result. DNA was detected by the PlexPCR  VHS multiplex assay and β-globin genes. RESULTS: Among the participants, 99%  (86/87) had a positive rapid treponemal test result. DNA was successfully  detected in 91% (79/87) of the lesion samples. PlexPCR VHS identified 5 herpes  simplex virus (HSV)/Treponema pallidum coinfections (2 HSV-1 and 3 HSV-2), only T  pallidum DNA in 62% (49/79), and only HSV-2 in 12.7% (10/79). While 19% (15/79)  were negative for all pathogens, none were varicella zoster virus positive. The  PlexPCR VHS had 68.4% agreement with the clinical diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Since  the PlexPCR VHS detects multiple organisms simultaneously, it can help to confirm  actual syphilis and identify other pathogen coinfections or the pathogen causing  the ulcer.",Oxford University Press,2023,https://repositorio.upch.edu.pe/handle/20.500.12866/14649

J.; Bustos Palomino, Javier Arturo; Handali, S.; García Lescano, Héctor Hugo","Resumen:Neurocysticercosis (NCC) is the most common helminthic infection of the human central nervous system. The antibody detection assay of choice is the  enzyme-linked immunoelectrotransfer blot assay using lentil-lectin purified  parasite antigens (LLGP-EITB, Western blot), an immunoassay with exceptional  performance in clinical samples. However, its use is mainly restricted to a few  research laboratories because the assay is labor-intensive and requires  sophisticated equipment, expertise, and large amounts of parasite material for  preparation of reagents. We report a new immunoprint assay (MAPIA) that overcomes  most of these barriers. We initially compared the performance of five different  antigen combinations in a subset of defined samples in the MAPIA format. After  selecting the best-performing assay format (a combination of rGP50 + rT24H +  sTs14 antigens), 148 archived serum samples were tested, including 40 from  individuals with parenchymal NCC, 40 with subarachnoid NCC, and 68 healthy  controls with no evidence of neurologic disease. MAPIA using three antigens  (rGP50 + rT24H + sTs14) was highly sensitive and specific for detecting  antibodies in NCC. It detected 39 out of 40 (97.5%) parenchymal NCC cases and  40/40 (100%) subarachnoid cases and was negative in 67 out of 68 (98.53%)  negative samples. MAPIA using three recombinant and synthetic antigens is a  simple and economical tool with a performance equivalent to the LLGP-EITB assay  for the detection of specific antibodies to NCC. The MAPIA overcomes existing  barriers to adoption of the EITG LLGP and is a candidate for worldwide use.",American Society for Microbiology,2023,https://repositorio.upch.edu.pe/handle/20.500.12866/14651

This study aimed to identify the peripheral blood cells of I. geoffrensis through microscopic evaluation. Blood smears were collected from wild adults and stained with Wright's stain. We differentiated leukocyte cells (neutrophils, eosinophils, lymphocytes, and monocytes) and platelets. Additionally, we observed signs of inflammatory reactions in cell morphology by incrementing cell size and active cytoplasm in neutrophils, eosinophils, lymphocytes, and platelets. These findings provide important considerations for hemogram interpretation in future research and individual clinical cases in Amazon River dolphins.

Three functional variants in the SCN9A gene (encoding M932L, V991L, and D1908G in Nav1.7), have recently been identified as stemming from Neanderthal introgression and to associate with pain symptomatology in UK BioBank data. In 1000 genomes data, these variants are absent in Europeans but common in Latin Americans. Analysing high-density genotype data from 7594 Latin Americans, we characterized Neanderthal introgression in SCN9A. We find that tracts of introgression occur on a Native American genomic background, have an average length of ~123 kb and overlap the M932L, V991L, and D1908G coding positions. Furthermore, we measured experimentally six pain thresholds in 1623 healthy Colombians. We found that Neanderthal ancestry in SCN9A is significantly associated with a lower mechanical pain threshold after sensitization with mustard oil and evidence of additivity of effects across Nav1.7 variants. Our findings support the reported association of Neanderthal Nav1.7 variants with clinical pain, define a specific sensory modality affected by archaic introgression in SCN9A and are consistent with independent effects of the Neanderthal variants on Nav1.7 function.",Nature Research,2023,https://repositorio.upch.edu.pe/handle/20.500.12866/14653
